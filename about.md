I’m Martin Brennan, and I’m a full stack software engineer based in Brisbane, Australia. I primarily enjoy working with C# and JavaScript but I’m always seeking ways to expand my knowledge and learn about new tools, languages and frameworks.

You can contact me via email at mjrbrennan@gmail.com or hit me up on twitter [@mjrbrennan](http://twitter.com/mjrbrennan)! You can also check out my GitHub profile {% include icon-github.html username="martin-brennan" %}, or my [StackOverflow profile](http://stackoverflow.com/users/875941/martin-brennan).

In addition to software development, my other loves include reading, writing, music, cycling, hiking, my lovely fiancé and our two sons!
