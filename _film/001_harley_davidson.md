A Harley spotted out at Maleny, QLD. Each Saturday you will find many such machines cruising through the mountain towns in the Sunshine Coast Hinterland, though much tamer than the members of the [[crabs_motorcycle_club|Crabs MC]]. From what I can tell, I think it's a [Dyna Super Glide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley-Davidson_Super_Glide) based on looking at [this article](https://www.rideapart.com/features/253590/the-big-list-important-harley-davidsons-throughout-time/), not sure of the year or variant.
