My friend invited me to a day out on his boat in the waterways around [South Stradbroke Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Stradbroke_Island). It was an excellent winter's day and the weather was with us, the sun was out and there wasn't too much wind or high swell. This was taken at [Jumpinpin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumpinpin_Channel) which is an area that constantly shifts and changes due to the wind and the tide.
