<span class="first-letter">A</span>NOTHER year gone, this is the third year that I'll be writing up a list of goals and sub-goals that I want to achieve for the year. It's been a massive year, and there is a lot to review. As I get older my years seem to get fuller, and I can't see that slowing down any time soon, especially with the boys getting older. There is already so much happening in 2018, so I'll go over my 2017 first to get the new year underway.

### 2017 Review

**Goal 1 - Whenever I finish a book, write a summary of essay of the book to this website**

I followed this one pretty closely, and even did it for [a few](/la-la-land) [different](/logan) [movies](/the-graduate) I watched as well. It helped me a lot with reflection about what I liked in the book, an exploration of my understanding the themes, and recalling with better clarity what the plot was about. There are two books I haven't written an essay on yet, as I've only finished them this month; _The Shining_ by Stephen King and _Slouching Toward Bethlehem_ by Joan Didion. Both of these will be written in the new year.

There were also a couple of shorter books I read that I felt I didn't really have much to say about. Not that I didn't enjoy them, _The Old Man and the Sea_ by Ernest Hemingway and _Heart of Darkness_ by Joseph Conrad. I didn't want to overextend myself writing essays for books when I didn't think I need to, lest I spoil myself on the idea. I think I did pretty well however, and my [post archive](/archive) can attest to that!

**Goal 2 - Write one article per month on my technical blog**

I didn't quite do this though I still ended up with fourteen posts this year [on my technical blog](https://martin-brennan.com). I focused more on this blog and writing (when I wasn't slacking off of course!). What happens here is that often I don't even think to write articles for my tech blog -- I solve a problem onto work and then it's on to the next problem! I am working on a couple of posts on my development workflow over there, so I hope to get a few more articles in in 2018.

**Goal 3 - Write three short stories, and finalise editing on my Crabs MC novel**

Parts of this goal were accomplished, and others fell by the wayside. I was able to finish editing around a quarter of my novel (tentatively titled _Bottom Feeders_). Editing ain't easy, I wrote about this [back in August](/editing-process), and it's slower going than I thought it would be. I would really like to finish editing the first draft in the first half of 2018.

I finished two short-novelette length stories, as well as some [microfiction stories](/canto-del-jilguero). I'm about three-quarters through the third short story. I need to then go back and edit those stories, which are around 10-15k words each. So my view of 2018 contains a lot of editing, but that is great. And it will enable me to work on the second part of this goal, which was:

> It would be wonderful if I could start writing query letters to publishers in early 2018.

**Goal 4 - Go on at least one camping trip with friends and one solo camping trip** and **Goal 5 - Get a boat license**

I never ended up doing either of these because of our move to Melbourne. For my best mate's buck's party in March we are all going on a two day camping trip so that be a step in the right direction toward getting started with camping. My partner and I would love to make camping a part of our boys' life growing up. Perhaps later in 2018 the boat license could still be in reach, as we are looking like we will move back up to Queensland!

**Goal 6 - Get rid of Reddit**

I still somewhat struggled with this. I've installed site blocker extensions on my phone, and my computer, and gotten rid of Reddit apps, though there are still times I feel like I want to look at it. Though these days I feel a lot less like I _need_ to look at it, and more that I do it out of boredom. It's getting easier to stop using Reddit, and I feel like this year my usage of the site will dwindle to zero. The same thing happened back in my days of Something Awful Forums. Nowadays I go on there, and I can't even get into it for more than a few minutes.
