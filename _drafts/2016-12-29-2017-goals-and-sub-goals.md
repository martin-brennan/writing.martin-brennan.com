It's that time of year again. For the past two years, I've written up a list of goals and sub-goals that I want to achieve for the year. The first thing I usually do is recap what goals I made in the previous year, and go over what I achieved, before outlining the next year's goals! So without further ado, here is the review.

### 2016 Review

**Goal 1 - Get married.**

Didn't do this one...yet! Time just got away with us, and we ended up spending our money on other things (a new PC and a trip to Japan!). We will get there one day but we are in no big rush, our little family is chugging along just fine! If we do get married in the next year, it will be a little civil ceremony with a celebration with family afterwards, nothing too crazy.

**Goal 2 - Pay off credit card debt.**

This was done....kinda! We consolidated it with my personal loan into one personal loan, which is so much better. If anyone is worried about their credit card debt, I reccomend doing something similar. The main benefit is that you have one payment to make, and you cannot get further in debt. Ideally, you wouldn't go into debt in the first place, but that is sometimes hard to avoid. Many people have to learn this lesson the hard way.

If the temptation to use "free money" is there, then you sure as hell are going to use it. If we ever get a credit card again, it will be the lowest limit possible, and used in very specific or emergency situations. A tip I've heard of is to freeze your credit card in ice so you can't just use it whenever you want. You are forced to consider your decisions.

**Goal 3 - Complete a 50km bike ride.**

Didn't quite get here. To be honest I have been slack with my long distance rides. The furthest I got was 20km. I still ride everyday from home to the train station, but I need to get on top of the rides again this year. This is more to do with lack of commitment than anything, so it's my bad!

**Goal 4 - Complete a first draft of the novel Iâ€™m writing.**

Ding ding ding! We have a winner here. I completed the first draft of my novel with a week to spare, on the **23rd of December 2016**. The draft is approximately 85,000 words, and the story is about the fall of a once-great motorcycle club, the Crabs MC, which is a rabble of losers and misfits that can't even intimidate the residents of the peaceful town they live in. They are bossed around by the Devil's Faithful MC, and one last heist will make or break their club. The Rider, a loyal member, rides a bicycle with a two-stroke engine, ever since his own bike was stolen, and he and the gang will need a hell of a lot of help to pull the job off.

It was a wonderful experience to write a novel, and it was a lot of work. I wrote the whole thing longhand then typed it up once I wrote ten pages or so ahead. The process was interesting. The starting point of the story was really from a single character, The Rider, which I thought of when I saw a man writing a bicycle with a two-stroke engine attached one day. I wrote an initial outline with some main story points, and thought up some other club members. Right from the outset I wanted the club to suck, to be the underdog losers, and be lorded over by another motorcycle club.

I wrote about five thousand words in
