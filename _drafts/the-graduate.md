<blockquote class="hero"><p>My whole life is such a waste</p><cite>— Benjamin Braddock</cite></blockquote>

<span class="first-letter">I</span>N THIS classic film backed by a Simon and Garfunkle soundtrack Dustin Hoffman plays Benjamin Braddock, a clean-cut golden boy with loving parents and the world at his feet. He has just graduated from four years at college and his future lays vast and limitless before him, and at his graduation party all of his parent's friends are happy to see him and offer their advice. So why is Ben so eager to get away from the people he has known all of his life, to shut himself away in his room? Why does he look as if he is on the verge of a panic attack while his party guests are all smiles? Why is this young, smart kid so worried about his future?

You may have been in Ben's situation yourself, which is why it may feel so relatable. Young people everywhere feel the pressure to succeed in school, to make something of themselves, to have a clear goal for the future, and not to let their parents down. These feelings of unease and confusion about the future and what to do with one's life can be hell to deal with, especially for a person who has not yet clearly defined their sense of self. This is where we meet Ben, escaping from a house full of his parent's friends spouting opinion as if it were an absolute path to success, running from phrases like "There is a great future in plastics. Think about it." And when Ben finally manages to break away from the crowd and reach the refuge of his own room and the solitude of his own thoughts, he stumbles into something that he could not have prepared for, which could change the course of his future in an instant — Mrs. Robinson.

The beautiful and stately wife of Ben's father's business partner, played by Anne Bancroft, persuades a reluctant Ben to drive her home. At every step Ben is reluctant. When Mrs. Robinson asks him to walk him to the door, when she asks him inside, when she offers him a drink, Ben is trying to leave, to get away and back to his own thoughts. But Mrs. Robinson is persistent, and Ben finally realises, breaking out in a nervous sweat, that Mrs. Robinson is not just trying to be nice to him when he says his famous line

> Mrs. Robinson, I think you're trying to seduce me.

In her daughter's room Mrs. Robinson ambushes him and bares her naked body, and confesses how much she wants him. Ben flees from the house as Mr. Robinson arrives, and from that night onward she is in control of his life. Ben cannot stop thinking about her offer, and after an embarrassing stunt on his birthday where his parents force him into the pool in a scuba suit, Ben decides to rendezvous with Mrs. Robinson at the Taft Hotel.

It is interesting to watch a movie where the main character is so unsure of himself. It made Ben a much more relatable character. As he waits for Mrs. Robinson to arrive at the hotel his nerves are shot, and he looks as though he is ready to flee at any moment. Blustering about the lobby awkwardly he is obviously terrified of running into anyone he might know there or arousing any suspicion, to the point of almost entering a function on the pretense that he was invited. He is so scared that he doesn't even book a room for the affair. When Mrs. Robinson arrives, she is the one who must take control of the situation.

Cooly entering the hotel bar where Ben is fidgeting over a drink, she orders a drink for herself when Ben fails to even attract a waiter's attention. She suggests at first, then directs, that Ben should go and book a room for the night, and when Ben calls from a payphone to let her know the deed is done she guides him step-by-step how they should meet in the room. This continues when they are alone together, as Mrs. Robinson guides him where to stand, and tells him what to do while she undresses. One gets the impression that she has done this all before. Ben is almost scared into leaving, but she knows exactly what to say to keep him there. She calls him inadequate.

From here Ben's summer spirals into a whirlwind of passion as he lounges around the pool by day and visits Mrs. Robinson at the Taft Hotel by night. He avoids thinking about his future at all, and does not pick a graduate school to go to, much to the consternation of his parents. Ben seizes the opportunity to blow off responsibility and have an exciting affair with a married woman, and why not? Many _people_, not just college students, would jump at the chance to shirk responsibility. Eventually though, this is not enough, and we find that Ben isn't just worried about his future, he worries about the kind of person he is and he longs for someone to connect with.

Ben attempts to connect with Mrs. Robinson one night in the Taft, though it is in vain. The two of them barely have anything in common, anything to have a conversation about, and Mrs. Robinson would rather not talk. Ben tries to talk about art, but she says she is not interested in art and doesn't know anything about it. As Ben keeps prying we start to understand why Mrs. Robinson is the way she is. She and her husband sleep in separate rooms. They've never loved each other, not really. They met in college while Mrs. Robinson was a student of _art_. And it turns out that the only reason that they married is that Mrs. Robinson fell pregnant with her daughter, Elaine. Her daughter is a sore spot for Mrs. Robinson, and she forbids Ben from taking her out on a date or talking about her. Knowing her background, we must assume that Mrs. Robinson doesn't want her daughter's life to end up like her own, loveless and empty. She would rather have her daughter finish college like she never got to. Ben is upset by the whole conversation but eventually resigns himself to what he is doing and says:

> Let's not talk about it. Let's not talk at all.

Eventually though the pressures of his family, and Mr. Robinson, win out as they always do, and Ben is forced into the awkward situation of taking his lover's daughter out on a date. Mrs. Robinson is furious and Ben tries to apologise, but she does not listen.
