title: The Writing of Martin Brennan
email: mjrbrennan@gmail.com
description: > # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  I’m Martin Brennan, a Software Engineer by day, and a writer whenever I can wrangle it. Genre fiction is my domain — I enjoy writing horror, sci-fi, fantasy, western, and everything else in-between, first in longhand, then typed into the devil-machine. I take cues from every place.
  
  The authors that inspire me are Cormac McCarthy (my God), Stephen King (my Prophet), J. R. R. Tolkien, George R. R. Martin, Hunter S. Thompson, George Orwell, John Steinbeck, and Kurt Vonnegut.
