[{"title":"11/22/63 by Stephen King","content":"> Home is watching the moon rise over the open, sleeping land and having someone you can call to the window, so you can look together.\n>\n> <cite>-- Stephen King</cite>\n\n![11/22/63](/assets/112263.jpg)\n\nThis is now tied with _The Stand_ as my number one King book. I absolutely adore this book and it turned out to be so much more than I thought it would be. The core plot of the novel is that Jake Epping, an English teacher in Maine, is shown a portal back in time to 1958 by the proprietor of a local diner he frequents, named Al. He accepts a mission from Al to go back in time to prevent the Kennedy assassination in 1963. Al had attempted the same thing himself, but was forced to come back to the present when he developed cancer. Jake grows to love the past more than the present, and grows to despise his target, Lee Harvey Oswald.\n\nThis book hooked me from the very beginning and _would not let go_. It is just over 700 pages, and I read the whole thing within a few days of starting it. I read over 150 pages a day, the fastest I have ever read any book. I just couldn't put it down. There were times when I was having trouble sleeping when I read it, and Jake's singular obsession with Oswald bled into my own dreams.\n\nThen, just as you are being entertained by Jake's time travel escapades in the 1950s, King turns the tables on you and presents the greatest love story he has ever written. Jake meets Sadie when he is teaching at a school in Texas on the outskirts of Dallas and his life changes forever, so much so that he decides to stay in the 50s with her and his beloved school students and teachers. Their love is full of dizzying highs and deep tragedy, as well as the dark secret that Jake must hide from her. I read a quote somewhere, that King successfully tricks nerds expecting the usual sci-fi story from him into loving a romance subplot. And I agree. He does it so perfectly and completely that I would consider Jake and Sadie ad the most realistic couple of fiction I have ever read.\n\n> Dancing is life\n\n_11/22/63_ is King at his absolute peak, and it actually has a fantastic, bittersweet ending, which are not usually the author's strong point. I will forever recommend this book to everyone with even a passing interest in fiction.\n","content_html":"\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>This is now tied with <em>The Stand</em> as my number one King book.

Some of the most standout chapters are the ones in which Bateman takes a 80's band, be it Huey Lewis and the News, Genesis, or Whitney Houston, and analyses it in detail, in essence spewing out a Wikipedia article because he tries to fit in by being up to date with the coolest bands and albums.\n\nI must warn you this book is extremely gory and not for the faint of heart.

He doesn't enjoy group sports or community sings, and would rather go steady with a single girl rather than have sex with as many partners as possible as conditioning would normally dictate.

Huxley's future, however, is almost utopian in comparison. No one is ever wanting for food, water, or shelter, drugs are distributed freely, there are endless leisure activities and unrestricted sexuality and polygamy that is encouraged as a healthy and necessary practice.\n\nThe scariest part about _Brave New World_ is that the citizens do not _want_ things to be different. They are genetically and psychologically conditioned from before birth to accept their lot in the caste system and be utterly incapable of free thought or understanding what it means to be in a different caste.

There is beauty in its perfection and scientific triumph, and the idea of happiness and world peace is not entirely unattractive.

From the first few pages of reading Steinbeck's introduction where he paints a portrait of the Salinas Valley I was hooked. Steinbeck is an author that held me in awe of the mastery of his craft, much in the same way that Cormac McCarthy did when I read <a class='internal-link' href='/blood-meridian'>Blood Meridian</a>. It made me hope that if I could write something even a tenth as beautiful in my life, I would die happy.\n\nThe story is a generational tale without a strict central plot, following the lives of members of the Trask and Hamilton families, both in Connecticut and in the Salinas Valley in California. It is similar in this way to <a class='internal-link' href='/one-hundred-years-of-solitude'>One Hundred Years of Solitude</a> by Gabriel Garcia Márquez, though I enjoyed _East of Eden_ much more, perhaps because of its more conventional American setting. The novel touches on themes of family, God, choice, the duality of man, and the age-long conflict between good and evil. Nature vs. Nurture is also a central theme, examining the question of whether a person is born evil, or whether their circumstances and upbringing make them that way.\n\nWhat breathes life into the story are the characters. Samuel Hamilton, the Hamilton family, Charles and Adam Trask, Lee, Cathy Ames, and later Caleb and Aaron Trask are complex people with differing motivations and stories. Steinbeck builds them up across the generations, and makes them believable. In Cathy Ames Steinbeck creates a chilling psychopath, devoid of love or human emotion, reminiscent of serial killers like Ted Bundy. Both Charles and Adam and Caleb and Aaron are parallels of Cain and Abel in the bible, a story which has special significance in the novel.\n\nSam Hamilton is a larger than life Irishman, a dreamer and an inventor, whose many patent applications and inferior land keeps his family poor for most of their years. Lee is a Chinese servant of the Trask family, who at first around people pretends to be dumb and talks in broken pidgin English. However Lee is one of the smartest characters in the book, who raises Cal and Aaron himself and keeps the Trask household whole through the many years Adam spends as a broken man. Without the characters, this book would be nothing but nice descriptions of California.\n\nAnother thing I liked was that the novel was interesting from a historical perspective. Steinbeck puts a lot of detail in about the late 19th century and early 20th century America. I loved learning about what people ate, how they got around, what they did for their work and in their spare time, and how they lived. Descriptions of farm and ranch life, and what people did as daily chores and how they conducted business with one another was fascinating, as well as the stories of the General Army and the Civil war from Adam and Charles' father Cyrus.

Adam, after being apart from his brother for ten years due to Charles' suspicion of Cathy, decides to write a letter to reconcile with the man.

One night Dessie's appendicitis causes her appendix to burst and instead of fetching a doctor straight away Tom gives her a home remedy and tells her to rest. When she dies he blames himself, and poor misunderstood and solitary Tom kills himself after writing a letter to his family implying that a horse kicked him in the head instead to spare his Catholic family the shame and grief of a suicide.\n\nThe central theme of _choice_ is what stuck with me. Charles, and later Cal Trask, the parallels for Cain in the Bible, struggle with the idea that they were born evil. Cal even more because his mother Cathy is one of the most despicable characters in literature. An entire essay could be written on Cathy's actions and motivations alone. Cal knows that he sometimes does bad things for no reason, like tormenting his brother Aaron. This terrifies him into thinking that he is an evil person and he is destined to be that way for his whole life. That he was a born sinner because of what his mother was like. This is discussed in depth by Lee, Adam Trask, and Sam Hamilton when the twin boys are born. Lee spends time with Chinese scholars who learn Hebrew to translate the original Cain and Abel story which reads like this:\n\n<blockquote><p>And the Lord said unto Cain, \"Why art thou wroth? And why is they countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? And if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.</p><cite>— Genesis 4:6-7</cite></blockquote>\n\nLee finds that \"thou shalt\" is an incorrect translation from the word _timshel_, where it was interpreted that God is saying that Cain _must_ or _will_ rule over his desire to sin. Instead, Lee finds the translation should be \"thou mayest\", meaning that it is up to man whether or not he shall rule over sin or succumb to it, in this quote from _East of Eden_:\n\n<blockquote><p>The American Standard translation [of the Bible] orders men to triumph over sin (and you can call sin ignorance). The King James translation makes a promise in 'Thou shalt,' meaning that men will surely triumph over sin. But the Hebrew word timshel—'Thou mayest'—that gives a choice. For if 'Thou mayest'—it is also true that 'Thou mayest not.' That makes a man great and that gives him stature with the gods, for in his weakness and his filth and his murder of his brother he has still the great choice. He can choose his course and fight it through and win.</p><cite>— Lee</cite></blockquote>\n\nEveryone has a choice in their life on what they do. Whether they are good or evil, or whether they follow the course of their ancestors. It is up to the individual, and that is what makes mankind unique. Although I found that the first half of the novel had a lot more steam than the second half, the thing as a whole had so much to say and so much impact that it left a lasting impression on me. There is so much about this novel that I have not covered with this essay, so much to discover and enjoy, I implore you to go out and read it. _Timshel_!\n","content_html":"\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>There are a few books you may read in your life that change you in some profound way, or stun you with their beauty in a way that makes the book stick in your mind for a long time after you finish reading it. <em>East of Eden</em> was such a book for me. From the first few pages of reading Steinbeck’s introduction where he paints a portrait of the Salinas Valley I was hooked. Steinbeck is an author that held me in awe of the mastery of his craft, much in the same way that Cormac McCarthy did when I read <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"/blood-meridian\">Blood Meridian</a>. It made me hope that if I could write something even a tenth as beautiful in my life, I would die happy.</p>\n\n<p>The story is a generational tale without a strict central plot, following the lives of members of the Trask and Hamilton families, both in Connecticut and in the Salinas Valley in California. It is similar in this way to <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"/one-hundred-years-of-solitude\">One Hundred Years of Solitude</a> by Gabriel Garcia Márquez, though I enjoyed <em>East of Eden</em> much more, perhaps because of its more conventional American setting. The novel touches on themes of family, God, choice, the duality of man, and the age-long conflict between good and evil. Nature vs. Nurture is also a central theme, examining the question of whether a person is born evil, or whether their circumstances and upbringing make them that way.</p>\n\n<p>What breathes life into the story are the characters. Samuel Hamilton, the Hamilton family, Charles and Adam Trask, Lee, Cathy Ames, and later Caleb and Aaron Trask are complex people with differing motivations and stories. Steinbeck builds them up across the generations, and makes them believable. In Cathy Ames Steinbeck creates a chilling psychopath, devoid of love or human emotion, reminiscent of serial killers like Ted Bundy. Both Charles and Adam and Caleb and Aaron are parallels of Cain and Abel in the bible, a story which has special significance in the novel.</p>\n\n<p>Sam Hamilton is a larger than life Irishman, a dreamer and an inventor, whose many patent applications and inferior land keeps his family poor for most of their years. Lee is a Chinese servant of the Trask family, who at first around people pretends to be dumb and talks in broken pidgin English. However Lee is one of the smartest characters in the book, who raises Cal and Aaron himself and keeps the Trask household whole through the many years Adam spends as a broken man. Without the characters, this book would be nothing but nice descriptions of California.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing I liked was that the novel was interesting from a historical perspective. Steinbeck puts a lot of detail in about the late 19th century and early 20th century America. I loved learning about what people ate, how they got around, what they did for their work and in their spare time, and how they lived. Descriptions of farm and ranch life, and what people did as daily chores and how they conducted business with one another was fascinating, as well as the stories of the General Army and the Civil war from Adam and Charles’ father Cyrus. A standout was when Adam Trask purchased a car, and the wisecracking mechanic came out and taught the entire family the complicated steps to start the car.</p>\n\n<p>There were parts of this book that hit me hard as well. Adam, after being apart from his brother for ten years due to Charles’ suspicion of Cathy, decides to write a letter to reconcile with the man.

A sprawling sci-fi epic that is at the same time deeply personal and poetic, Dan Simmons has achieved a monumental feat of storytelling with the first novel in the Hyperion Cantos. My partner picked this up for me as a birthday present after she had read glowing recommendations for it online. I don't often read sci-fi novels, mostly staying in the realm of literature, fantasy, and \"Stephen King\" (who I consider a genre onto himself), and it was initially difficult for me to get into, but about fifty pages in I was hooked.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nSet in a time hundreds of years after the destruction of Old Earth, humanity's home world has become a thing of legend, and the Hegemony of Man populates a web of over two hundred interconnected planets. Following a split with an AI of humanity's creation, the TechnoCore, and a separatist group known as the Ousters, mankind has the technology to achieve faster than light travel and instantaneous transportation through spacetime with portal-like devices called farcasters. Man's dominion is split between worlds that are connected by farcaster and those that are not, known as Outback worlds. It is in this part of the galaxy that the eponymous planet Hyperion is located. The entire story revolves in some way around the planet and its mysterious Shrike Cult, and the pilgrims chosen to visit the planet on the final Shrike Pilgrimage together. The heart of the novel lay in the stories of the pilgrims, and I have read that in many ways the story is akin to Chaucer's _Canterbury Tales_. Along their journey the pilgrims must recount their personal stories and reasons for coming on the pilgrimage through a set of what are essentially short stories within the main narrative.\n\nThese stories were by far my favourite part of the novel. The pilgrims are Father Lenar Hoyt, a Jesuit priest, Het Masteen, a Templar, Colonel Fedmahn Kassad, a Hegemony FORCE soldier, Sol Weintraub, a Jewish scholar and professor, Martin Silenus, a poet, Brawne Lamia, a private eye, and a man known only as The Consul, who was the consul of Hyperion for over a decade. All of the pilgrims offer a unique story and wonderful characterization, and there is not a one in the bunch that feels boring. That said there were two standouts for me, those of Sol Weintraub and Father Hoyt, and only one which I felt was a bit underwhelming, which was Brawne Lamia's. It is impossible however for any of the stories to be left out as they all offer critical backstory and world building details and a lend a grave intensity and gravity to the pilgrimage.

A sprawling sci-fi epic that is at the same time deeply personal and poetic, Dan Simmons has achieved a monumental feat of storytelling with the first novel in the Hyperion Cantos. My partner picked this up for me as a birthday present after she had read glowing recommendations for it online. I don’t often read sci-fi novels, mostly staying in the realm of literature, fantasy, and “Stephen King” (who I consider a genre onto himself), and it was initially difficult for me to get into, but about fifty pages in I was hooked.</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>Set in a time hundreds of years after the destruction of Old Earth, humanity’s home world has become a thing of legend, and the Hegemony of Man populates a web of over two hundred interconnected planets. Following a split with an AI of humanity’s creation, the TechnoCore, and a separatist group known as the Ousters, mankind has the technology to achieve faster than light travel and instantaneous transportation through spacetime with portal-like devices called farcasters. Man’s dominion is split between worlds that are connected by farcaster and those that are not, known as Outback worlds. It is in this part of the galaxy that the eponymous planet Hyperion is located. The entire story revolves in some way around the planet and its mysterious Shrike Cult, and the pilgrims chosen to visit the planet on the final Shrike Pilgrimage together. The heart of the novel lay in the stories of the pilgrims, and I have read that in many ways the story is akin to Chaucer’s <em>Canterbury Tales</em>. Along their journey the pilgrims must recount their personal stories and reasons for coming on the pilgrimage through a set of what are essentially short stories within the main narrative.</p>\n\n<p>These stories were by far my favourite part of the novel. The pilgrims are Father Lenar Hoyt, a Jesuit priest, Het Masteen, a Templar, Colonel Fedmahn Kassad, a Hegemony FORCE soldier, Sol Weintraub, a Jewish scholar and professor, Martin Silenus, a poet, Brawne Lamia, a private eye, and a man known only as The Consul, who was the consul of Hyperion for over a decade. All of the pilgrims offer a unique story and wonderful characterization, and there is not a one in the bunch that feels boring. That said there were two standouts for me, those of Sol Weintraub and Father Hoyt, and only one which I felt was a bit underwhelming, which was Brawne Lamia’s. It is impossible however for any of the stories to be left out as they all offer critical backstory and world building details and a lend a grave intensity and gravity to the pilgrimage.

The novel, first published in 1966, meticulously details the lead up to and the aftermath of the slaying of the Clutter family in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas, a crime that rocked the foundations of the community and sparked a nationwide manhunt for the two killers.<!--more-->\n\nUsing his extensive notes collected from interviews with the killers, the agents pursuing them, the residents of Holcomb and those close to the Clutter family, Capote paints a grim picture of a robbery turned to grisly murder. The interviews, conducted over seven years between the murders in 1959 and the novel's completion in 1966, provided Capote and his cousin Harper Lee with over ten thousand pages of notes to draw from when reconstructing the events. This level of detail and dedication of Capote is instrumental in painting a picture of the people involved, and creating a rawness and empathy for both the victims and even the killers.\n\nThe novel begins with an account of the daily life of the Clutter family in rural Kansas, in the days leading up to their murders on November 15, 1959. The patriarch Herbert Clutter is described as a well liked and respected member of Holcomb, who is known as a fair and generous employer amongst his farmhands. His wife Bonnie is clinically depressed and unable to leave the house on most occasions, a fact generally accepted by friends of the family. The Clutters had two adult daughters who had since moved out of home, Eveanna and Beverly, with the two younger children, Nancy and Kenyon, still living with their parents.\n\nCapote sketches out the particulars of the lives of the inhabitants of River Valley Farm. Nancy is an extremely popular girl in the community who has a steady boyfriend in the form of Bobby Rupp. Kenyon is an intelligent boy who has but one friend, who recently started seeing a girl, and enjoys working with electronics. The hopes and dreams of the family are laid bare, which makes it all the more heartbreaking to know that they will never be fulfilled.\nThe author does not detail the murders in complete chronological order, preferring to withhold those awful moments until half way through the novel. Rather, he delves into the backgrounds of the two killers, whose turbulent lives seemed to lead all along to the fateful Sunday.\n\nRichard Eugene Hickock was born on June 6, 1931 in Kansas City to hardworking parents that were unable to send him to college. He was a promising athlete in high school until an automobile accident left him with lasting injuries. He took a job as a mechanic, married once and had three children but then left his wife for his mistress. This too ended in divorce, and Hickock soon turned to a life of petty crime after being unemployed for a long period of time to make ends meet, favouring check fraud and theft, the crimes which eventually landed him in prison with Perry Smith.\n\nPerry Smith life was a tale of failure, abuse and woe. He was born on October 27, 1928 to \"Flo\" Buckskin and \"Tex\" John Smith, two rodeo performers in Huntington, Nevada. Smith grew up in a broken family after his parents divorced, his mother becoming an alcoholic from his father's bootleg whiskey business. He and his siblings lived with his alcoholic mother in San Francisco until she died. They were then placed in a Catholic orphanage where Smith was abused by the nuns for his lifetime chronic bed-wetting problem. He was then placed in a Salvation Army orphanage where one of the nuns tried to drown him. He kept a deep seated hatred for her the rest of his life.\n\nAfter a stint in the Merchant Marine and later the Army during the Korean War, Smith spent time in Washington state, where after a purchasing a motorcycle he was involved in a terrible accident which left his legs permanently disabled. He was also left with a drug abuse problem as he consumed huge amounts of aspirin to control the pain. Two of Smith's three siblings committed suicide early in their life, and his sister refused to talk to him after learning of his criminal activities, fearing for her own safety.\n\nSmith's story enraptured Capote so much more so than that of Hickcock, and this is quite evident throughout the novel. Smith is often shown to be a victim of the circumstances of his life, and as a thoughtful but emotionally stunted individual whose destiny was shaped by the abuse he suffered through. Hickcock on the other hand was largely glossed over by the author, seemingly dismissed as a petty thug who got in too much over his head. Throughout the years there has been intense speculation whether Capote, as a homosexual, had developed feelings for Smith that went further than their friendship. Such speculation can neither be proved or disproved though, and no one will ever get any answers from either men.\n\n![In Cold Blood, Richard Hickock and Perry Smith](assets/coldblood2.jpg)\n\nThe power of this novel is in the way that it transports you back into the hearts and minds of the people of Holcomb in 1959. Capote goes into obsessive detail over extremely minor characters and their daily lives, publishes letters sent to the killers, and uses creative fictional devices to describe environments and scenes in vivid detail. You end up occupying the lives of the characters, just as Capote did for six years while he waited for the lives of the murderers to end in Lansing state prison in 1966. For end they must, and end they do. You know throughout the whole novel that this is the inevitable conclusion to the entire saga. The killers at the end of a rope.\n\nThe way Capote keeps the reader engaged throughout the novel whilst knowing the conclusion to it is by withholding the exact order of the events of the murders until the murderers are captured in Nevada. They are tracked throughout the continental United States and Mexico by agents of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, led by agent Alvin Dewey. Agent Dewey is long suffering, his home life inseparable from his work while the investigation continues. You feel for him as Smith and Hickock constantly elude capture, even venturing through Garden City, Kansas at one point.\n\nWhen they are captured in Nevada, Dewey is triumphant. Though his only eventual reward is to hear a firsthand account of how an innocent Kansas family was methodically slaughtered by two men, obliterating them from existence. The most powerful lines in the book come at the end of this confession, describing sum total of what the killers gained from the crime. Duntz asks Smith:\n\n> Added up, how much money did you get from the Clutters?\n\nAnd Smith replies:\n\n> Between fourty and fifty dollars\n\n_In Cold Blood_ is a powerful novel, and a story of intense dread and heartbreak. It stands out as a literary classic of the True Crime genre, and although some facts claimed to be one hundred percent accurate by Capote have since been disputed, the novel's level of detail and methodical descriptions of even investigative methods and court proceedings are exemplary.\n\nThe only criticisms I had with it are that my mind sometimes wandered in these uber-detailed sections, though I would not cut them from the novel. All parts of the novel served to construct a world in which the reader is placed to live as the Clutters, the residents of Holcomb and Dick Hickock and Perry Smith lived. And to relive a gruesome chapter of American history, where a simple farming family was murdered, in cold blood.\n","content_html":"\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>These are the faces of the two men who destroyed a family, Richard Hickock and Perry Smith, in Truman Capote’s cold and heartbreaking true crime novel <em>In Cold Blood</em>.

Dick","content":"> What profit it a man if he gain the whole world but in this enterprise lose his soul?\n>\n> <cite>— Philip K. Dick, Man in the High Castle</cite>\n\n![Man in the High Castle](/assets/highcastle.jpg)\n\nReading about World War II is always fascinating. Tragedy and human suffering was perpetuated on an enormous scale by some of the most despicable men in history. In _Man in the High Castle_ Philip K. Dick imagines an alternate timeline of human history where the Axis powers are the victors of World War II. A history where the world is divided up between Germany, Italy, and Japan. The novel is set in a conquered United States of America, in which the west coast is owned by Japan and renamed the Pacific States of America (or PSA) and the east coast is ruled by the Third Reich, with a buffer zone along the continental divide. The central conflict of this novel is the machinations the great powers have between each other and within themselves, as well as the reemergence of American culture, and the idea that the whole world may not be real at all.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nDespite the premise of the novel it took me a few tries over the years to finally read this book all the way through. My friend lent it to me to read in 2010, and now I've finally read it in 2017. I found it hard to get into because of the first chapter, told from the POV of American antique dealer Robert Childan as he attempts to locate an artifact for a high-value client. I couldn't see where the story was headed, and I wasn't particularly engaged with Childan's character. However once I made t through the first few chapters and I was introduced to the rest of the main characters I was locked in. Each of the different factions are represented, and we follow this multi-POV structure for the whole story, which helps us get an idea of the mindset and cultural norms of all of the different powers.\n\nThere is Nobusuke Tagomi, a representative of the Japanese trade mission in San Fransisco, Frank Frink, a Jewish war veteran in hiding working at a factory that supplies Robert Childan, Juliana Frink, Frank's estranged wife who teaches Judo in Canon City, Colorado, Joe Cinadella, an Italian war veteran and truck driver who is Juliana's lover, Baynes, an Abwher agent posing as a Swedish industrialist, and the reclusive author Hawthorne Abendson, who wrote a widely-read book called _The Grasshopper Lies Heavy_. This book is central to the plot as well and is extremely meta; it depicts a world in which the Allied powers win World War II like in our own history, an idea which many of the characters in the book find absurd. Nevertheless the book is banned in the eastern states under Nazi control because of the ideas presented in it. As with all banned books, it the ban does little to curb readership.\n\nAnother book is central to the plot and the character's lives, one introduced to them by the Japanese, which beforehand was brought to them by the Chinese. The _I Ching_ is a divination text that the characters use when they are worried about a situation or wondering what they should do next. Some find comfort in the book's wisdom, and others cannot make important choices without it. The only characters that don't use it or place much stock in it are Germans, possibly due to their no-nonsense nature. The Nazis control all of Europe and Africa along with Italy, and some of South America, and although Hitler is still alive he is too sick from syphilis and other medical issues to lead the Reich, so Martin Bormann, Hitler's private secretary, is Chancellor.\n\nThe character's lives all intertwine across several core plots in the novel. Juliana Frink and Joe Cinadella decide to take a trip to upstate Colorado in order to meet Abendson. Tagomi purchases antiques off of Childan, one as a gift for Baynes, who is only visiting San Francisco as cover for his real meeting with General Tedeki to discuss Operation Dandelion, a Nazi plot to nuke the Japanese home islands in a pre-emptive war. Frank Frink and his business partner Ed open an American handcrafted jewelry business, and consign some of their wares to Childan, who finds a young Japanese couple who appreciate the spiritual force found in these simple pieces. One such piece of jewelry makes its way into the hands of Tagomi, and he attempts to find spiritual meaning and his place in the world, entering another alternate timeline in the process. The characters all struggle with their spirituality and moral grounding in some form or another, all of which links back to the old versus the new, and how they can make sense in a world that seems so wrong. The _I Ching_ seemingly has answers for all of these, but as we find further on in the novel for each decision the _I Ching_ makes, there is an alternate decision made in another world.\n\nWhat I liked most about this book were not the philosophical meanderings, of which there were many, but rather all of the \"what ifs\" and continuing alternate timelines. Like finding out the Nazis dammed up and drained the Mediterranean for _Lebensraum_ farmland, or that they have established colonies on Mars, Venus, and the Moon, or even their more sinister schemes like the genocide of and experimentation on the people of Africa. All of the things that turned out differently in the world because of mere chance. FDR being assassinated by Giuseppe Zangara instead of Chicago mayor Anton Cermak, and Reinhard Heydrich avoiding assassination and going on to become a powerful competitor to become the new Chancellor of Germany, vying for the position against Goebbels, Heydrich, Göring, and Seyss-Inquart after Bormann dies partway through the book. A lot of research by Dick has gone into making these situations plausible, and that makes them all the more chilling. In _The Grasshopper Lies Heavy_ the \"normal\" timeline even diverges from our own — after World War II there is a cold war between the United Kingdom and the United States, which ends with the eventual collapse of the US, leaving the UK as the sole world superpower.\n\nI found the ending, which I will not spoil, a little confusing though ultimately satisfying once I read about it a little more. It helps to keep in mind when reading the novel that Dick's work often has a central theme of alternate or distorted reality, where everything is not as it seems. I would love to read a continuation of the story as not all plot threads were tied off, even though some characters find catharsis. Philip K. Dick did intend to write a sequel but he never got around to it, because he could not bring himself to continue reading about Nazis.\n","content_html":"\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Reading about World War II is always fascinating. Tragedy and human suffering was perpetuated on an enormous scale by some of the most despicable men in history. In <em>Man in the High Castle</em> Philip K. Dick imagines an alternate timeline of human history where the Axis powers are the victors of World War II. A history where the world is divided up between Germany, Italy, and Japan. The novel is set in a conquered United States of America, in which the west coast is owned by Japan and renamed the Pacific States of America (or PSA) and the east coast is ruled by the Third Reich, with a buffer zone along the continental divide. The central conflict of this novel is the machinations the great powers have between each other and within themselves, as well as the reemergence of American culture, and the idea that the whole world may not be real at all.</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>Despite the premise of the novel it took me a few tries over the years to finally read this book all the way through. My friend lent it to me to read in 2010, and now I’ve finally read it in 2017. I found it hard to get into because of the first chapter, told from the POV of American antique dealer Robert Childan as he attempts to locate an artifact for a high-value client. I couldn’t see where the story was headed, and I wasn’t particularly engaged with Childan’s character. However once I made t through the first few chapters and I was introduced to the rest of the main characters I was locked in. Each of the different factions are represented, and we follow this multi-POV structure for the whole story, which helps us get an idea of the mindset and cultural norms of all of the different powers.</p>\n\n<p>There is Nobusuke Tagomi, a representative of the Japanese trade mission in San Fransisco, Frank Frink, a Jewish war veteran in hiding working at a factory that supplies Robert Childan, Juliana Frink, Frank’s estranged wife who teaches Judo in Canon City, Colorado, Joe Cinadella, an Italian war veteran and truck driver who is Juliana’s lover, Baynes, an Abwher agent posing as a Swedish industrialist, and the reclusive author Hawthorne Abendson, who wrote a widely-read book called <em>The Grasshopper Lies Heavy</em>. This book is central to the plot as well and is extremely meta; it depicts a world in which the Allied powers win World War II like in our own history, an idea which many of the characters in the book find absurd. Nevertheless the book is banned in the eastern states under Nazi control because of the ideas presented in it. As with all banned books, it the ban does little to curb readership.</p>\n\n<p>Another book is central to the plot and the character’s lives, one introduced to them by the Japanese, which beforehand was brought to them by the Chinese. The <em>I Ching</em> is a divination text that the characters use when they are worried about a situation or wondering what they should do next. Some find comfort in the book’s wisdom, and others cannot make important choices without it. The only characters that don’t use it or place much stock in it are Germans, possibly due to their no-nonsense nature. The Nazis control all of Europe and Africa along with Italy, and some of South America, and although Hitler is still alive he is too sick from syphilis and other medical issues to lead the Reich, so Martin Bormann, Hitler’s private secretary, is Chancellor.</p>\n\n<p>The character’s lives all intertwine across several core plots in the novel. Juliana Frink and Joe Cinadella decide to take a trip to upstate Colorado in order to meet Abendson. Tagomi purchases antiques off of Childan, one as a gift for Baynes, who is only visiting San Francisco as cover for his real meeting with General Tedeki to discuss Operation Dandelion, a Nazi plot to nuke the Japanese home islands in a pre-emptive war. Frank Frink and his business partner Ed open an American handcrafted jewelry business, and consign some of their wares to Childan, who finds a young Japanese couple who appreciate the spiritual force found in these simple pieces. One such piece of jewelry makes its way into the hands of Tagomi, and he attempts to find spiritual meaning and his place in the world, entering another alternate timeline in the process. The characters all struggle with their spirituality and moral grounding in some form or another, all of which links back to the old versus the new, and how they can make sense in a world that seems so wrong. The <em>I Ching</em> seemingly has answers for all of these, but as we find further on in the novel for each decision the <em>I Ching</em> makes, there is an alternate decision made in another world.</p>\n\n<p>What I liked most about this book were not the philosophical meanderings, of which there were many, but rather all of the “what ifs” and continuing alternate timelines. Like finding out the Nazis dammed up and drained the Mediterranean for <em>Lebensraum</em> farmland, or that they have established colonies on Mars, Venus, and the Moon, or even their more sinister schemes like the genocide of and experimentation on the people of Africa. All of the things that turned out differently in the world because of mere chance. FDR being assassinated by Giuseppe Zangara instead of Chicago mayor Anton Cermak, and Reinhard Heydrich avoiding assassination and going on to become a powerful competitor to become the new Chancellor of Germany, vying for the position against Goebbels, Heydrich, Göring, and Seyss-Inquart after Bormann dies partway through the book. A lot of research by Dick has gone into making these situations plausible, and that makes them all the more chilling. In <em>The Grasshopper Lies Heavy</em> the “normal” timeline even diverges from our own — after World War II there is a cold war between the United Kingdom and the United States, which ends with the eventual collapse of the US, leaving the UK as the sole world superpower.</p>\n\n<p>I found the ending, which I will not spoil, a little confusing though ultimately satisfying once I read about it a little more. It helps to keep in mind when reading the novel that Dick’s work often has a central theme of alternate or distorted reality, where everything is not as it seems. I would love to read a continuation of the story as not all plot threads were tied off, even though some characters find catharsis. Philip K. Dick did intend to write a sequel but he never got around to it, because he could not bring himself to continue reading about Nazis.</p>\n","date":"15-Aug-21","url":"/man-in-the-high-castle","category":"essay","tags":"book, fiction"},{"title":"Meta","content":"# Using this site\n\nWhen walking beneath the canopy, you may come across <a class='internal-link' href='/works'>links like this</a>.

This is compounded through the repetition of character names. There are several Aurelianos, José Arcadios, and Remedioses in the book, so when more than one generation is alive at once it can become confusing, especially when the characters have similar beginnings and ends.

Through neglect, spurned love, isolation, emotional abuse, incestuous relationships, and insanity, the Buendía family constantly destroys itself from within. This is mirrored later in the book by the red ants and termites that later come to infest, consume, and destroy their ancestral home. These qualities make all of the characters so decidedly _human_ that it is difficult not to empathise with them at some level, even though their actions are sometimes abhorrent.\n\nThroughout all of this there are high points of stirring rebellion, passionate love, and a drive for creation and invention that often leads to a fountain of wealth or production that brings the Buendías and the town of Macondo out of the muck and into prosperity again. Though as more lynchpin characters grow old and die, the further the family and the house fall into disrepair, as the loop of their family line gets tighter and tighter.\n\nI may go back to this book when I am older, as I feel the keen edge of old age and solitude a little more. Perhaps then I can understand another theme that Márquez lays out throughout the text; the theme of solitude. Many characters become comfortable with their own solitude, and spend much of the book coming to terms with that feeling of being alone in the world. Some force it upon themselves, though others are forced there through old age or neglect, insanity, and even their own family.\n\nThe magic and mystery of Macondo has at the beginning of the novel, when José Arcadio Buendía takes his sons Aureliano and José Arcadio to see the inventions of the passing gypsies is wonderful. Seemingly on an island floating separate from the world in some other dimension, Macondo attracts all kinds of strange travellers, and harbours secrets like the grounded shipwreck of a Spanish galleon. Though as time passes, Macondo is opened to the world, and the magic gradually fades, your heart begins to feel heavy with the weight of the Buendía family's troubles. The magic always remains in the background, just hidden and out of sight behind flickering ghosts, there but only if you could reach out and touch it.\n\nOne Hundred Years of Solitude is a book about _life_.

Some I liked more than others and so I'll give a brief summary of what I liked and why.\n\n### Some Dreamers of the Golden Dream\n\nA sort of criticism of the San Bernadino valley and 60's suburban culture, wherein a woman having an affair decides to kill her husband, and ends up inadvertently burning him to death inside a Volkswagen. She is by no means a master criminal, and is soon caught and convicted, admitting the crime. Joan's skill at journalism shows through here as well, and the authenticity of the story is drawn from interviews, court sittings, and phone calls with the parties involved. It reminded me of <a class='internal-link' href='/in-cold-blood'>In Cold Blood</a>, though a little more absurd.\n\n### John Wayne: A Love Song\n\nI liked this one because it involved Joan Didion hanging out with John Wayne and Dean Martin as the men and various other hangers on were on the set of Wayne's 165th movie. It dwells on Wayne's masculinity and mythic image. Stories of these old 50's and 60's entertainers always fascinate me; this one was no exception.\n\n### Marrying Absurd\n\nA look into the strange world of Las Vegas weddings and why they became so popular despite their tackiness (no blood test or waiting period required!)\n\n### On Going Home and Notes From A Native Daughter\n\nA history lesson and rumination on the places Joan Didion grew up and called home -- the area around Sacramento. It reads as partly a memoir and a tapestry of California culture and origins. ~~I have not yet read _East of Eden_~~ (Update: I read <a class='internal-link' href='/east-of-eden'>East of Eden</a> and loved it!) though from what I understand it talks about similar areas, so I am keen to read that later this year.\n\n### Letter from Paradise 21° 19' N, 157° 52' W\n\nAn essay about Hawaii and the impact of Pearl Harbour years later. I found this one interesting because Didion writes about the men who died at Pearl Harbour, then in the Pacific Theatre and Vietnam after that. They are buried in a place called Punchbowl Crater, at the National Memorial Cemetary of the Pacific. Didion talks about the cheapening of their sacrifice by the locals bringing tourists in there, and the sailors at the current naval base's proclivities for the red light districts.\n\n### Rock of Ages\n\nExploring the Ruins of Alcatraz and the few people that still live in that solitary island fortress. Deemed too expensive to run in the 60's, it eventually became a target for real estate developers and city planners looking to turn a notorious place that once held Al Capone into a gentrified place.\n\n<hr />\n\nIn general I preferred the stories about Joan's own past, and the general historical based essays and slice of life stories. What I couldn't relate to were the stories of the counter-culture movement, especially the eponymous essay _Slouching Toward Bethlehem_. The people involved seemed insufferable, though parallels could be drawn to the movements young people attach to today. I couldn't dig it.\n\nThis was my first time reading a collection of essays, and I am glad I chose someone as articulate and engrossing as Joan Didion to start with.\n","content_html":"\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>A collection of well-crafted essays by Joan Didion, Slouching Towards Bethlehem is like going through the looking glass and landing in 1960’s California.

She is by no means a master criminal, and is soon caught and convicted, admitting the crime. Joan’s skill at journalism shows through here as well, and the authenticity of the story is drawn from interviews, court sittings, and phone calls with the parties involved.

At least by the person who's waiting.\n>\n> <cite>— Haruki Murakami</cite>\n\nI've been trying to broaden the genre and writers of the books I've been reading this year, so I read _South of the Border, West of the Sun_ as recommended by my wife. I devoured it in just a few two hour reading sessions, and Murakmi's simple and straightforward writing style mixed with the beautiful imagery he weaves left me thinking about the book long after I finished reading.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nIn the novel we are placed into the point of view of Hajime, an only child born into a family in postwar Japan. Early on Hajime explains the stigma behind being an only child, and how he has always felt distant from his peers because they are in families with brothers and sisters. That is until he meets Shimamoto, another only child his age, a girl who walks with a limp because of polio, who is assigned to sit with him in class because they are neighbours.\n\nHajime and Shimamoto form a close bond. They like and dislike the same things, and they listen to classical music on the couch for long afternoons together, Shimamoto placing records from her father's collection on and off the turntable in a sacred ritual. She shares Hajime's love of books and music, and the experience of being only children. Hajime feels that he has finally found someone to connect to, someone who breaks into his lonely and solitary life, a person who fills the missing part of his soul in a way that nobody else could. There is an undercurrent of love and desire between the two, though neither of them recognise it because they are so young.\n\nInevitably, as young people often do, the two of them drift apart when they go to different high schools, Shimamoto's being only one town over. Despite visiting her a few times on the short trip, Hajime eventually stops going. He rationalises this to himself, thinking that Shimamoto has new friends and wouldn't miss him anyway. He concludes that it would be awkward, that they would be too different. We later find that Shimamoto had been hurt and confused by his absence, and had always waited for him to come visit, never having another friend in her life.\n\nIn high school Hajime finds new confidence through swimming, forming a physique and hobby that lasts him the rest of his life, and fosters a deeper interest in books and music. He has a few close friends, and stops feeling like a sickly only child. Hajime even has a girlfriend, a plain girl called Izumi.\n\nHajime desperately wants to have sex with Izumi, especially after their first kiss. She is reluctant however, and not ready to take that huge step in her life. Hajime becomes increasingly frustrated with her and cannot help but compare her to Shimamoto, with whom he shared a deeper connection. This is why he is able to, with minimal internal conflict, enter into a tempestuous sexual relationship with Izumi's cousin, a girl who she had grown up with. He describes his attraction to her as \"magnetism\", and to him their relationship has nothing to do with love, rather Hajime's seeking of the \"sense of being tossed about some raging, savage force, in the midst of which lay something absolutely crucial\".\n\nIn the end, Izumi discovers their affair, and is completely destroyed by it. Hajime sees her only once afterward and tries to explain to her that it was an act of passion, that his betrayal had nothing to do with their relationship, though this just deepens Izumi's hurt and resentment. The experience leaves Hajime with a feeling of self loathing, as he wonders who he truly is and grapples with the realisation that he can do evil. His propensity towards infidelity, and how he struggles with these urges while trying to be a good man, is a core theme of the novel.\n\nHajime spends his twenties working an unfulfilling job, unable to connect with new coworkers or start new relationships, withdrawing into himself and his own interests on a kind of self-imposed exile. He drifts through life until one day while shopping he sees a woman in a red coat who limps like Shimamoto used to. Hajime chases after her through the busy streets of Tokyo, and sits near her in a cafe for hours without plucking up the courage to talk to her. This is partially because he is unsure if it is her and partially because he feels guilty about how he never went to see her after she moved away. When he tries to chase her to a taxi and finally talk to her a mysterious man confronts him and gives him an envelope full of cash to stay away from Shimamoto. The whole encounter is so dreamlike that Hajime is unsure if it even happened, though the money is still in his dresser drawer the next morning.\n\nUpon looking back this encounter feels like a turning point in the novel, an entrance into an alternate timeline by Hajime. Without it, he may have eventually forgotten Shimamoto and continued living his life the way he had been. This is not the case, however, as Shimamoto had seen his face as she climbed into the cab. And so, many years later, when Hajime has married and opened two successful and trendy bars with the help of his rich father-in-law, Shimamoto re-enters his life, drifting into Hajime's bar the Robin's Nest one rainy night. Hajime's life is thrown upside-down by Shimamoto, who has had her leg fixed in the years since their last meeting. She is now a mysterious woman, reserved, beautiful, and elegant all at once, who refuses to reveal anything about her past or present situation. One thing is constant though, the two of them pick back up right where they left off. Though he has two children and a wife in Yukiko, Hajime begins to feel the pull of his old urges, and he grapples with his feelings for Shimamoto and his responsibility toward his own family.\n\nAfter this first visit, Shimamoto does not come back for a long time, and Hajime almost gives up hope of seeing her again. But on another rainy night months later, she appears at the Robin's Nest once more. In some ways she is like Jenny from Forrest Gump, drifting in and out of the main character's life like some otherworldly muse. She has a strange request for him, to visit a river. Hajime remembered a beautiful river and town he had visited on the other side of the country while he was backpacking as a student, and in yet another act of betrayal of a woman he loves he lies to his wife and tells her that he is going to a conference so he can travel to the river with Shimamoto. It is on this day together that we learn that Shimamoto lost a baby a day after it was born, and the purpose of the trip was to scatter the child's ashes. It is also on this day that Hajime, as their flight back to Tokyo is delayed, considers never going back to his wife and children and instead running away with Shimamoto.\n\nHajime continues seeing Shimamoto every week for the next few months, either at the Robin's Nest or going out for lunch together. His wife suspects that there is something different about him, or something going on with his life, but he just shrugs it off or lies to her about what he is doing. Eventually Shimamoto, following the same pattern, disappears again, leaving a note to say that she \"probably\" won't be able to come back \"for a while\". Hajime once again becomes lost and purposeless. He tries to fill the void Shimamoto has left once again by burying himself in work, redesigning both of his bars, spending time with his wife and children, and swimming. He knows he cannot keep living the way he is, feeling like he is \"stuck on the airless surface of the moon\" and that if Shimamoto was gone for good, he would have no-one to connect with and talk about his true feelings with, as if he were an only child again.\n\nFor the final time Shimamoto reappears on another rainy night after months of absence. The only thing their final meeting can lead to is something that has been built up for twenty-five years, ever since they were twelve years old. They travel together to Hajime's cabin in Hakone, the cabin he had visited with his family time and again, and they have sex. This final betrayal of his family, the succumbing to the allure of the past, is a catharsis that Hajime needs to move past Shimamoto. She leaves in the middle of the night, and he never sees her again.\n\nWe are left with the doubt that Shimamoto even existed, or at least I was. To me she was a manifestation of his mid-life crisis, and a representation of his tendency to look for that unattainable past, ignoring the present in the process. She barely interacts with other people in the novel, and she disappears from a remote cabin after she and Hajime consummate their passion, leaving in the middle of night with no car, the Nat King Cole record she had given to Hajime disappearing along with her. Later, when Hajime checks his dresser drawer for the envelope of money the mysterious man gave him, he finds it is no longer there. This is a novel about the dangers living in the past or the future, and not giving your all to your loved ones in the present. It reminds me in a way of the fall of Gondor in _The Lord of the Rings_, as described by Gandalf:\n\n> Childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry, or in high cold towers asking questions of the stars. And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin.\n\n If you do this you will always be trying to capture something that will always be out of reach, and you will never be satisfied. Memory and recollection is good, planning for the future and having goals is good, but dwelling in these timeless never-worlds is bad for your soul. South of the border is an idyllic place, one we all strive to reach, but to the west of the sun lies only death and ruin. In the end, it is Yukiko and her love that pulls Hajime out of his depths of despair, and they decide to start life anew together. This beautiful quote finishes the book:\n\n> Until someone came and lightly rested a hand on my shoulder, my thoughts were of the sea.\n","content_html":"\n\n<p>I’ve been trying to broaden the genre and writers of the books I’ve been reading this year, so I read <em>South of the Border, West of the Sun</em> as recommended by my wife.

The way King brings the Overlook to life through its bloody history and monstrous projections of long-dead ghosts sends chills down your spine. It feels less like a mountain resort, and more like a gateway to hell; a living, breathing thing that swallows up the unfortunate souls that visit there.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThe core of the story revolves around the Torrance family, who follow their patriarch Jack to become winter caretakers of the hotel. A caretaker is necessary, because high in the Colorado Rockies when deep winter sets in, the hotel becomes snowbound and prone to damage from high winds and heavy snowfall. Jack is a former alcoholic and a former schoolteacher with disturbing rage issues. He is a writer, who hopes to use the winter solitude to finish the play he's working on and mend the ties between his family, burying the past in a blanket of white. His wife, Wendy, is worried about Jack. Their marriage like most has not been perfect, and while she hopes that the winter will help them all heal, the prospect of being all alone together gives her a bad feeling. Not the least because the previous winter caretaker, Grady, had killed his wife and daughters in a fit of insanity.\n\nDanny, their son, once had his arm broken by Jack when he was three years old as his father pulled him sharply away from a mess he had made. This has made Wendy extra protective of him. Danny is special. He has a friend that only he can see, Tony, who gives him visions and premonitions. These sometimes violent insights don't always come true, but they are true often enough that Danny is scared when Tony shows him visions of a dark figure chasing him with a mallet.\n\nDanny's developing psychic abilities let him see things that aren't there, know where lost things are, read and talk to people telepathically, and sense feelings and emotions. When Danny meets the hotel's cook, Dick Halloran, he recognizes someone with the same gift as him. Dick calls this a \"shine\", something that his grandmother had before him, which allowed the two to have conversations \"without ever moving their lips\". Dick warns Danny that the hotel can sometimes be a scary place for people like them. That Danny might see things, horrible things, but not to worry that Dick doesn't _think_ the things can hurt him.\n\nHe _thinks_.\n\nIt is this gift that makes Danny so appealing to the presence of the Overlook. A massive psychic power trapped inside its walls for a whole winter. The \"manager\" of the hotel would rather Danny stay there forever instead, and will go to any lengths to posess it. Danny's power acts as a kind of amplifier for the Hotels apparitions, giving them a physical form and strength that they did not have before. Though their power is not enough. To kill Danny they need help from someone already in the physical world, someone that can get to Danny. Someone who is weak willed and prone to losing control. That's where Jack Torrance comes in.\n\nThe way King develops Jack's inner demons is much more subtle than Nicholson's portrayal in the film. Maybe it was just because of Nicholson's malevolent presence, but you expect him to fly off the handle at any moment. That the Jack Torrance in the film is already batshit crazy under the surface. Jack Torrance in the novel is a flawed family man doing the best he can. Struggling with alcohol and anger problems inherited from his abusive father, Jack experiences three major failures that put the family in their current predicament. His alcoholism almost cost him his life, barreling down a darkened road. His rage almost cost him his marriage, when he broke Danny's arm as when the child was three years old. And it cost him his well-paying teaching job when he assaulted a student.\n\nThese demons and resulting feelings of self-loathing were the perfect footholds in his mind for the Overlook to take hold. The tragedy of the story is that Jack never really had a chance. The family has many opportunities to avoid their fate, and the story may well have gone differently if Jack simply worked the caretaker job by himself. He may have come out the other side with a fresh outlook on life and a completed play that would become successful. Danny's powers would not have awoken the hotel. Perhaps Jack would not have been consumed.\n\nWendy Torrance is also much better developed than Shelley Duvall's portrayal in the film, because she is a main point of view character. The inner conflict between her love of Jack and her need to protect Danny and herself can lead to some frustrating decisions, but she herself acknowledges when she is being irrational. Divorce is not so clean cut, especially not when your partner is an alcoholic with anger issues. And it becomes impossible when you are trapped together and your partner is trying to kill you. Wendy's psychological and physical strength when grappling with an insane Jack later in the novel is a great representation of a mother drawing upon superhuman strength to protect their child.\n\n_The Shining_ is a classic King novel, full of slow building dread, rich character development (Dick Halloran is a personal favourite, especially when he shows up in <a class='internal-link' href='/it'>IT</a>), and many Checkov's guns (the boiler, the snow mobiles). As in <a class='internal-link' href='/it'>IT</a>), King includes a rich history of depravity for the Overlook Hotel through old files that Jack finds in the basement. As always King sometimes has a tendency to ramble on at some points, but as always the extra development and background is worth it in the end.
