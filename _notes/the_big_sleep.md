This took me ages to read, but I have no idea why. I was just in a reading slump I suppose. The character of Philip Marlowe was intriguing, like a hard-boiled Don Draper mixed with Harvey Bullock from Batman, a smooth talking private eye who is always a step ahead of the bad guys. Chandler's writing was really engaging and I loved the style, and I could see how it influenced other media, _The Big Lebowski_ for one.
