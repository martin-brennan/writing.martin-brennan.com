title: Swamp Lullaby
---

A short story I wrote for the TL;DR press [NOPE 2 horror anthology](http://tldrpress.org/index.php/2020/10/16/nope-2-line-up-announcement/). This story was featured on the TL;DR press Twitter, and read along with 5 other published stories and poems at a Halloween reading, receiving a lot of positive feedback.

[[Big Billy Claret]], more than a ghost but less than a man, has been wandering the bayou a long time. Many have tried to kill him for good, but they didn't know his secret. When Billy takes a young boy called [[easton_porter|Easton]], the boy's father will stop at nothing to get him back.
