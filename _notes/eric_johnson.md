Eric is an orphan, born in 1986 in Charlotte North Carolina. Eric's mother and father were killed very early on after [[the Thaw]], leaving him to fend for himself in the dark and the wilderness for several years, constantly on the edge of starvation and death until he found [[the Island]]. Eric is involved with [[Cathy Darrow]], and their carelessness leads to the death of [[Anthony Watts]] at the beginning of [[The Thaw]]. Their relationship is somewhat strained by this, and a feeling of being trapped leads Eric to join [[the Gardeners]] on their journey to Colorado, which Cathy cannot forgive him for. Eric is taken as a ward by [[Gloria Palermo]] on the road, who teaches him scouting and reconnaissance, as well as [[Colonel Cortland Briggs]], who teaches him shooting and combat and survival skills.
