When walking beneath the canopy, you may come across [[works|links like this]]. Hover over them with your mouse and you will see a premonition of things to come. Every sacred scroll has a section like this to help you find your way in the maze as Theseus once did:

<div class="sunken-box">
    <div class="example-backlink-boxes">
        <div class="backlink-box">
            <a class="internal-link" href="/the-thaw">The Thaw</a><br>
            <div style="font-size: 0.9em">The Thaw is a post-apocalyptic zombie survival novel set in the heart of America.</div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

Some notes are callow youths frolicking under a new moon, while others are wizened elders savouring the last full moon of winter. A "fullness" rating attached to each note represents how fleshed out the ideas within are.

* ðŸŒ‘ - New moon. The note has recently been created and is little more than a placeholder.
* ðŸŒ’ - Waxing crescent. There is a little more detail here, but still much more to come. I may not have found the subject that interesting, or I could not find the words or the time to expand.
* ðŸŒ“ - First quarter. The note is reasonably well developed but lacks depth. Most of the scrolls you find will be in this state. Maybe some day they will wax to full.
* ðŸŒ• - Full moon. I will rarely touch these scrolls. They are ready to be stored in the annals, and are fleshed out fully with well-developed ideas on the topic.

Wander over to the [[Library]] to see what I mean. An example of ðŸŒ• is [[brave_new_world|Brave New World]], an example of ðŸŒ’ is [[i_am_legend|I Am Legend]].
