Zakour is a nation on the western continent, sharing a natural southern border with [[Revana]] along the [[Ulanbarov Mountains]]. Zakour is a land of deserts and badlands, red rock and tall mesas. Its interior is hot and inhospitable to all save for those creatures and people who know how to use the land. The people of Zakour settled here after a long migration from the green lands to the west of the massive mountain range known as the [[Al-Lunrah Mountains]].

Toward the eastern shore there is a vast metorite lake known as the [[Cradle of Joy]], which was the first plentiful source of water found by the people of Zakour after their long migration. This highland lake empties out into a river which cuts through vast canyons to eventually empty out in a wide delta floodplain and into the sea. Where the cliffs flank the river emptying into the plain, the Zakourites carved their great capital [[Zakourad]] out of the stone itself, keeping cool during the heat of the day, and hanging vast gardens from the walls of the cliffs all the way to the riverbanks below.

Further back on the shores of the lake in the land of the ochre mesas is the city of [[Mazoukal]], where people live on the plentiful fish of the lake. Far to the south, not quite at the edge of the [[Ulanbarov Mountains]], is the settlement of [[Safiraat]] where those that relished the desert life on the great migration decided to settle.

The only other fertile lands in Zakour lie on the northeastern coast, where the smaller [[Mountains of Zahur]] catch rainfall from the coast and feed several rivers that enrich the coastal soil. [[Razhmir]] lies here in an narrow bay, and further down the coast is the city of [[Asfalid]].
