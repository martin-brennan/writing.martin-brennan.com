An interesting look at life as the last man on earth, that raises questions about who is the monster and who is truly human when humanity has perished. This book inspired many others and was influential in the development of the zombie and apocalypse-by-disease genres, as well as films like _The Omega Man_. _I Am Legend_ was full of dramatic sequences that had me on the edge of my seat, heart pumping, as if I were filling the shoes of Robert Neville. By getting into Neville's head and feeling the hopelessness of his day-to-day life, and the struggles he has with alcoholism and depression, you are able to sympathise with his impossible, lonely, and maddening situation. You can read this book in a day if you are inclined to, and I highly recommend that you do.
