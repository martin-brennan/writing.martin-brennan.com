Gloria was born in 1969 in Miami, the third child to second generation Italian immigrants. Her husband Alejandro was killed in the early days of [[the Fall]], as they tried to prevent people from stealing her father's boat at the marina. Six months pregnant at the time, Gloria was beaten and pushed over, causing her to lose the baby as well. Taking her survival into her own hands, Gloria trained and fought her way across the country, becoming an extremely capable and critical member of [[the Island]], and [[sam_hayes|Sam Hayes']] second-in-command. Sam and Gloria have developed feelings for one another, which grow stronger each step they take toward Colorado, but neither of them want to betray the memory of their dead partners.
