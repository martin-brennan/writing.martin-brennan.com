It was not at all what I was expecting really. Dealt with a lot of heavy existential and religious themes. Is God watching us? Is there a plan, or does chaos rule? Why do bad things happen to good people? Should we try and be good people because God will punish us if we aren't, or just because it is the right thing to do? It had a lot of really funny moments and the regular Coen brothers wit on display. I can see how this might seem boring or pointless to some people though, if you're not particularly interested in religion the questions this film asks.

Definitely not my favourite Coen brothers film, but I think I would get more out of it if I watched it again.
