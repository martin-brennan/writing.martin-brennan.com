I am Martin Brennan, an Australian writer, and above all I enjoy writing genre fiction. I write horror, sci-fi, fantasy, western, and everything else in-between, first in longhand or at the typewriter, then processed into the devil-machine.

My published works and the manuscripts that I am currently working on are listed below, as well as an index of stories that I have written and posted on this blog, and links to various works in full. The links to my current manuscripts are knowledge bases where I write backstory and worldbuilding for these novels.

## Published Works

### Swamp Lullaby (TL;DR Press Horror Anthology 2020)

A short story I wrote for the TL;DR press [NOPE 2 horror anthology](http://tldrpress.org/index.php/2020/10/16/nope-2-line-up-announcement/). This story was featured on the TL;DR press Twitter, and read along with 5 other published stories and poems at a Halloween reading, receiving a lot of positive feedback.

[[Big Billy Claret]], more than a ghost but less than a man, has been wandering the bayou a long time. Many have tried to kill him for good, but they didn't know his secret. When Billy takes a young boy called [[easton_porter|Easton]], the boy's father will stop at nothing to get him back.


### Only The Dead (TL;DR Press Family Anthology 2019)

A short story I wrote for the TL;DR press [Kindred family anthology](http://tldrpress.org/index.php/2019/02/27/tldr-press-presents-family-themed-lineup-for-kindred/). _Only the Dead_ was written as a backstory piece for the primary antagonist of [[The Thaw]], though it is a standalone story in its own right.

[[Colonel Cortland Briggs]] reflects on his life of war in a crumbling Columbus, Georgia cemetery, long after an event which plunged America into chaos.

### Stories

Along with these short stories I have several short novellas (9-15k words) which I'm not quite sure what to do with, as they seem to be of too strange a size to submit anywhere, and some other stories not published on this blog because they have been submitted to competitions or otherwise held back for future submissions.
