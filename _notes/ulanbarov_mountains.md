The Ulanbarov Mountains are a range on the western border of [[Revana]], which serve as a natural border to [[Zakour]] in the north. The Ulabarovs are fold mountains, and in their shadow are the city of [[Yenisev]] and some of the most verdant farmland in all of Revana. The range is largely impassable, especially in winter, and a single high road is kept and guarded at the keep of [[Koleb]]. This protects Revana from the threats that arise from wild tribes deeper in the range, and from incursions originating in Zakour.

On the leward side of the range it descends into rocky crags and the arid, windswept badlands that precede the deserts of [[Zakour]]. There is not much life here, save for scorpions and lizards and other creatures suited for such a barren existence. The people of Zakour keep no settlements so close to the mountains, believing them to be a dour and depressing place, and their closest city is [[Marassid]] 100 miles to the north. Any trade between Zakour and Revana through the mountains is sporadic at best, most opting to trade via the sea. Those who brave the dangerous crossing and avoid the wild tribes within may sell their wares for princely sums in Yenisev.
