Many were of the cursed Line of Torgond. The line began in [[Altor]], with Alorn I Torgond declaring himself king of the [[usolism|dawnfolk]] and the promised land.

## 1st Generation

### Alorn I Torgond

Married [[line_of_oren|Telena Oren]]. Alorn was the first leader of the [[usolism|dawnfolk]] and the prophet that was given dreams and premonitions by [[usolism|Usol]] to lead the dawnfolk to the promised land of Altor, where he would find the Valley of Dawn. Born in Revana to simple ranchers, at a young age Alorn first saw visions from Usol as he woke one day to work, and from them on he set about gathering followers to his cause.
