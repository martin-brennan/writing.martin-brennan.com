Deceased wife of [[Sam Hayes]]. Michelle Hayes (n√©e Thurman) was killed in the early days of [[the Fall]] by her neighbour, and is survived by her daughter [[Sarah Hayes]]. Born in 1967 in Pine Bluff as the third child of wealthy cotton farmer and landowner, [[George Thurman]], Michelle was expected to first go to college for her education and then to marry a son of one of the wealthy men her father knew. Though she did neither -- Michelle eloped with Sam, who she met at a dance in 1987, then worked as a waitress to support them and then Sarah. Sam and her father never saw eye-to-eye, and her father never quite forgave her for marrying a working class man like Sam.
