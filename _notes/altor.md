Altor is the promised land for the people of [[King Alorn Torgond I]], revealed to him in a prophetic vision while he wandered starving with his [[Arisen Knights]] and faithful [[Dawnfolk]] across the plains of [[Revana]]. Altor is a fertile land and the Dawnfolk and the [[Lunai]] wished for nothing, and were masters of the westlands. They trained horses here and became proficient riders with vast herds. There is wild game, and the soil across the entire continent bears crops well, except in the frozen reaches of the north. There is a large population of black bears living there, one crossing into legend when King Alorn Torgond I slew it in the pass to the Valley of the Dawn.

Historically near-impossible to navigate to due to a ring of jagged rocks mired in confusing fog, Altor lay relatively untouched by the folk of the southern lands. The native people of Altor, named the Lunai, were the descendents of the followers of [[Al-Gailun]] who came from [[Lun]] far to the western edge of [[Zakour]].

The mountains of Altor were rich with obsidian, and monolithic spires of the rock jutted from the ground all over the continent, especially on the southwestern peninsula where the people of [[Al-Gailun]] made their home. There the soil was black but bountiful, and lurid moss spread across the black hills and jagged peaks. In later years, this became the haunt of the [[Marrow King]] and his armies of cursed souls.Their capitol was named Kulzugai, which in their language meant "shadow of life".

To the east of the continent is the [[Bay of the Morning]], and the town of [[Bjorhaven]], the site where Alorn Torgond I and his dawnfolk first made landfall. On the bluffs above is [[Mael's Rest]], where the eternal fire is kept burning by the descendents of Mael as decreed by the king. To the north is a great forest and the southern arm of the mountain range that encompasses the [[Valley of the Dawn]], where the [[Line of Torgond]] makes their seat of power at the [[Dawnhold]].

[[Torgaldur]] lies on a plain astride a great river to the west of the mountains and forests of the Dawnhold, and serves as the first line of defence from the [[Lunai]] and later the Marrow King. To the north of the Dawnhold beyond another mountain range and vast grasslands and hills lies the city of [[Aurveth]], on the shores of [[Lake Ustvar]].

To the west of Bjorhaven there is a vast saltwater swampland where rivers from the mountains and from Torgaldur empty into the sea. Beyond the swamps and Torgaldur and a mountain range to the west lies the lands that once belonged to the Lunai, a land of small lakes and rivers and a mournful forest along a long peninsula. It was here that th city of [[Feornar]] once stood, before the curse of the Marrow King. No it lay abandoned and decrpit, and has become a haunted place.
