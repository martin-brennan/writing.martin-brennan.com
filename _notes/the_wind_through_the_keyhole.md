This was a wonderful little detour of two Dark Tower short stories, one within the other like a babushka doll. The inner story was like a fairy tale and built up more of the mythology behind the gunslingers and their world. Because this was written after all of the other Dark Tower books, King has absolute mastery over the feel and the dialogue of Mid-World. I would pay a lot of money for him to just keep writing Mid-World short stories forever. I love the world of the Dark Tower and it always feels like you have been spending years with the characters after you are done with the book.
