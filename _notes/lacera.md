Lacera is a nation whose territory encompasses a vast archipeligo of islands at the eastern end of [[Revana]]. Its capital [[Orenel]] lies on an island roughly in the center of the archipeligo, built on a bay carved into white cliffs rising into a great peak, overlooking a pristine deep-water harbour. The islands were found by the people of Oren when they departed the shores of [[Saralas]] seeking new lands.

The twin cities of [[Amariel]] and [[Marielis]] serve as the bread baskets of Lacera, their irrigated soil used to grow huge amounts of rice, with orchards and plantations providing plentiful fruit for the Lacerans and for trade with other nations.

[[Caloura]] rests in the shadow of twin dormant volcanoes on the largest island of the archipeligo. The island is mostly forested, and Caloura serves as a base for mining operations delving deep below the volcanoes, using redirected lava to power the forges used for crafting renowned Laceran stell, second only to that of [[Palen]].

[[Liora]] on the easternmost peninsula of Revana is a constant source of headache for the Lacerans. Whoever were the true first settlers of this spot is lost to time, but now both Liora and the Revanan city of [[Nemezgar]] stand next to each other there, causing skirmishes and arguments every year. The cities share a wall, and passage between the two is strictly controlled by a guard house garrissoned by both Revanan and Laceran men.
