title: Only The Dead
---

A short story I wrote for the TL;DR press [Kindred family anthology](http://tldrpress.org/index.php/2019/02/27/tldr-press-presents-family-themed-lineup-for-kindred/). _Only the Dead_ was written as a backstory piece for the primary antagonist of [[The Thaw]], though it is a standalone story in its own right.

[[Colonel Cortland Briggs]] reflects on his life of war in a crumbling Columbus, Georgia cemetery, long after an event which plunged America into chaos.
