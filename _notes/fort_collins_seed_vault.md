A secure and technologically advanced facility in Fort Collins, Colorado, meant to preserve plant types and seeds in case they are wiped out by natural or man-made disasters. [[Private Patterson]] tells [[Colonel Cortland Briggs]] about the vault when he is found by [[Gloria Palermo]] and her patrol, and it is this catalyst that drives [[The Gardeners]] to travel across the country, to solve their problems with a blight that destroys most of the crops that they plant.
