The Arisen Knights is used to both refer to a holy warrior order and the group of five original followers of [[Alorn Torgond I]]. The original followers are named Jorm, Ustor, Lorhan, Bor, and Telgor.

### Jorm

The first of the Arisen, who followed Alorn I from the very beginning in the streets of [[Novostra]].

> Jorm’s amber eyes were full of concern beneath the fine brows and long auburn hair. Jorm had a face that you immediately trusted, nobility without pride, caring without weakness, and strength without cruelty. Jorm had once been a member of the city watch of Novostra before leaving his post to follow Alorn.

### Ustor

> Ustor had outstripped the other animals on his father’s farm in eating before he was five, and it showed. Ustor was huge and barrel chested, with a full bushy black beard streaked with grey, chocolate-brown eyes, and long flowing black hair kept out of his face with a crimson silk headband in the Revanan style. All his youth he had dreamed of leaving his farm, and when he reached the big city of Novostra and found the opportunity to visit distant lands with Alorn, he could not resist.

### Lorhan

> Lorhan, a mournful knight whose raven-dark hair fell in graceful curtains around golden eyes and high cheekbones. Lorhan was a descendent of the people of Palen the Smith in the south of [[Saralas]], and he was dour and stoic like those ancestors who had dwelt among the mines and mountains. Having made his way west from [[Nova Saralas]] and through [[Gadrov]] over the years while working as a caravan guard, Lorhan saw something in Alorn that he had been searching for his entire life since he had left his homeland of Palen.

### Bor

> Bor had once been a sailor in the paltry navy of Revana, and he had a deeply tanned face with neck muscles like whipcords, his bald head crisscrossed with tattoos of heavenly bodies. Bor left behind the taverns and the warehouses of Novostra where he had been wasting his early retirement years drinking and brawling to follow Alorn north to Cantemir, to see the sea once again, and beyond across the open ocean to fabled Altor.

### Telgor

> Telgor was a young scholar, once apprenticed and destined to become a theologian in service to the Abaas in the great library of Cantemir. A callow youth with fair hair and a pinched look from living the frugal life of a scholar, Telgor made up for his inexperience of life and military matters with religious zeal, and careful and considered counsel.
