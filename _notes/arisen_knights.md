The Arisen Knights is used to both refer to a holy warrior order and the group of five original followers of [[Alorn Torgond I]]. The original followers are named [[Jorm]], [[Telgor]], [[Ustor]], [[Lorhan]], and [[Bor]].

### Jorm

The first of the Arisen, who followed Alorn I from the very beginning in the streets of [[revana|Navostra]].

> Jorm’s amber eyes were full of concern beneath the fine brows and long auburn hair. Jorm had a face that you immediately trusted, nobility without pride, caring without weakness, and strength without cruelty.

### Ustor

> Ustor had outstripped the other animals on his father’s farm in eating before he was five, and it showed. Ustor was huge and barrel chested, with a full bushy black beard streaked with grey, chocolate-brown eyes, and long flowing black hair kept out of his face with a crimson silk headband in the Revanan style.

### Lorhan

> Lorhan, a mournful knight whose raven-dark hair fell in graceful curtains around golden eyes and high cheekbones. Lorhan was a descendent of the people of Palen the Smith in the south of Saralas, and he was dour and stoic like those ancestors who had delt among the mines and mountains.

### Bor

### Telgor
