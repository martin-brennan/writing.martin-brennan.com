Revana is a nation on the southern continent, on the southeastern side of what the Revanans call the Ulanbarov Mountains. It is comprised mostly of wide grassland and savannah, as well as rolling hills where great hill-cities are built. The Long Coast of Revana stretches for hundreds of miles, from the mountains in the west to the Avelaar Peninsula in the east. Revana is often in turmoil from many competing religions, all following their own dieties and leaders, though at the time of [[Alorn Torgond I]] it was firmly in the grip of the Patriarchs of Azbrev.

The Revanans are a hardy and belligerent people, ambitious and greedy on the whole. They are great ranchers and have vast herds of cattle, as well as trading in saffron, poppies, and pepper.
