Revana is a nation on the southern continent. It is comprised mostly of wide grassland and savannah, as well as rolling hills where great hill-cities are built. The Long Coast of Revana stretches for hundreds of miles, from the [[Ulanbarov Mountains]] in the west to the [[Avelaar Peninsula]] in the east. Revana is often in turmoil from many competing religions, all following their own deities and leaders, though at the time of [[Alorn Torgond I]] it was firmly in the grip of the [[religions_of_revana|Patriarchs of Azbrev]].

The Revanans are a hardy and belligerent people, ambitious and greedy on the whole. They are great ranchers and have vast herds of cattle, as well as trading in saffron, poppies, and pepper. They share a mountainous border with the people of [[Zakour]].

There are several major cities where the Patriarchs of Azbrev make their seat. There is [[Yenisev]] in the west beneath the Ulanbarov Mountains, [[Cantemir]] on the Long Coast, and [[Nemezgar]] to the east on the [[Avelaar Peninsula]], where the continent joins the [[lacera|Laceran Archipelago]]. The Archon of Revana, in the time of Alorn Torgond I being [[Lurh Dragovic III]], moves his court between these three cities in times of peace, but will stay secure in the citadel of Cantemir in times of war.

There are many hill-cities, harbour towns, and larger villages in Revana. Some of the larger hill-cities are [[Novostra]] and [[Gadrov]] in the southern interior; major harbour towns were [[Nova Saralas]] in the east below Lacera where the forefathers of the Revanans first landed, and [[Rovanov]] far to the south of the eastern coast.
