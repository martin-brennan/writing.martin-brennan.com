A settlement located on the slopes of and the caves within Pinnacle Mountain in Arkansas. The settlement is run by [[George Thurman]], [[Easton Porter]], [[Sebastian Sawyer]], [[Marques Carruthers]], and [[Barbara Conway]], and has many more people living there, with much tougher defenses, than [[the Island]]. [[The Gardeners]] arrive there about a week into their journey, where [[Sam|sam_hayes]] is surprised to find [[George|george_thurman]] still alive. A feast is thrown in celebration of their arrival, and the settles speak with the Gardeners long into the night, with Sam and [[Cortland|colonel_cortland_briggs]] both convincing George to support them for their own purposes.
