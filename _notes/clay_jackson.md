The ruthless one-time kingpin of the largest Black gang in East Memphis, Clay Jackson now acts as [[The King]]'s second-in-command. He enacts orders from The King with brutal efficiency, but their relationship is not a comfortable one, and ever is Jackson looking for his opening to take over, biding his time and gathering a group of loyalists to enact a coup. Jackson has a hideous burn scar all across the right-hand side of his shoulder, neck, and face. Jackson resents The King for forcing him into the siege that caused the burns, saving his life, and then for forcing him to join his band of pirates.
