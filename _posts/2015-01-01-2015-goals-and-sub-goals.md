The new year has come again, and this year for the first time I’ve written a definitive list of five goals that I will aim to complete or improve upon in the next year.

I’ve tried to make sure that each goal is achievable and well defined, and each one starts with smaller steps that will evolve to larger steps later.

**Goal 1 - Earn more money, and further my career.**

- My aim is for a substantial raise at my current company OR
- Move to a new company to continue my career path there, on a better salary.
- The reason for this is twofold. I want to keep expanding my skills and further my career, and I also want to continue to grow my family and my future. I believe the extra money will go a long way towards this, and is by no means a stretch for a software engineer in the current market.

**Goal 2 - Plan time for a healthier lifestyle with my fianće.**

- Take time out each morning for a family walk together, after my son wakes up but before breakfast.
- Plan healthy meals one week ahead with my fianće and ensure we stick to our budget for groceries.
- Limit serving sizes and treats.
- My knee has been straining and painful lately, so I hope that at least daily walks will improve the situation. I assume the pain is caused by sitting down constantly at work. I would also like to have a standing desk eventually.

**Goal 3 - Move to a house.**

- This one is simple, our family can’t grow and thrive in a small apartment.
- Related to goal (1), more money is required for a bigger place or house.
- This may also bring about a puppy!
- I would love to get somewhere that has 3–4 bedrooms, and from research this looks achievable with extra income.

**Goal 4 - Work on my quickness to annoyance, work on not reacting without thinking, and think about the impact this behaviour has on my family.**

- I think that I’ve been a little too quick to anger or annoyance lately over very trivial things. I need to take deep breaths and use positive thinking when I feel myself start to feel this way.
- Think in terms of “It’s not that bad!”. Situations where I often react badly are not generally cause for negative reactions. My impulsive reactions are often disproportionate. I need to stop being so reactionary.
- Spend more time playing with my son, or I will regret not doing so when he is older.
- Similarly, spend more time with my fianće improving ourselves and our relationship.

**Goal 5 - Continue to develop my craft.**

- I’m trying to write more, and I’m a software engineer. I need to keep learning and improving both crafts.
- Write at least 1 paragraph a day and 1 journal entry a day.
- Write stories and essays longhand with pad and pen first to avoid distractions, and to better the draft process.
- Continue development of open source projects, e.g. Rain http://martin-brennan.github.io/rain
- Focus this year on furthering Ruby skills, and start learning node.js and Swift application development in earnest.
- Actively plan and seek more article topics for my tech blog at http://www.martin-brennan.com
- There it is, my list of goals for the coming year. I hope that this year is fruitful for myself, my family, and everyone else!
