Okay, I've finally gone and done it and [made a Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/martinbrennan). My motivations for doing so are outlined on the page, but here is the main thrust of it:

> So why make a Patreon if I'm happy to amble along penniless on this writing hobby in my spare time? The answer is you. I want to hear feedback from other people about my writing, what do you like, what do you hate, what do you want to see more of? I want to release my short stories and have them read and adored and/or reviled, and I want to connect with other writers. Most of all I want to know that someone is out there reading my writing, and that will help me get me off my arse to write instead of browsing reddit.

Rest assured that even if I don't make a penny from Patreon I will still post my writing online. Thank you for reading this not-oft-updated blog for all these years. I don't plan on stopping any time soon!
