<span class="first-letter">E</span>VEN though I always diverge from my reading list plans, I thought I'd still write a little post about I what I hope to get through in 2018. I'll be writing essays for most of these as well, as I did last year. Last year was a great year for reading, where I wrote an essay for _almost_ every book I read. I found it to be a great habit for reflecting on the themes of the book and what I got out of it, and I would reccommend doing this even for just a few novels yourself.
