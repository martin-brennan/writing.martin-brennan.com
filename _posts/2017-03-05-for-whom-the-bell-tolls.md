<blockquote class="hero"><p>It tolls for thee</p><cite>â€” John Donne</cite></blockquote>

<span class="first-letter">N</span>O MAN is an island,<br />
Entire of itself.<br />
Each is a piece of the continent,<br />
A part of the main.<br />
If a clod be washed away by the sea,<br />
Europe is the less.<br />
As well as if a promontory were.<br />
As well as if a manor of thine own<br />
Or of thine friend's were.<br />
Each man's death diminishes me,<br />
For I am involved in mankind.<br />
Therefore, send not to know<br />
For whom the bell tolls,<br />
It tolls for thee.<br />
