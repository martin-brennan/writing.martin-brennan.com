I was linked to these two videos by Jim Weirich when I started working with Ruby and Rails again by my friend/colleague/boss and they really helped get into the mindset of working with Ruby in a good, SOLID OOP way. They also gave me a path to not use Rails magic too often, and to decouple logic and classes from the framework as much as possible.
