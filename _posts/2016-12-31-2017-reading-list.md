I love to read, and I try to get through five to ten books a year. I thought this year I'd try something different and outlay all of the books I want to read on the year, and then write a summary or essay on each one after I've finished reading it. I'll also go over the books I've read for the past two years (2015 and 2016) in this post, and what I reccomend.

If you haven't read ASOIAF, you should read it **now**. Especially if you are a fan of the HBO show A Game of Thrones, though having read the books after watching the show, I think you would be much better off reading the books first. They are a terrific example of a "realistic" fantasy which deals with war, political play, religion, and social class that is inspired by real historical periods like the War of the Roses. There are also some magical elements, like every good fantasy series. Written from a third-person perspective of one POV character at a time, GRRM's is a master of characterisation. Each of the POV characters is believable, has wants and needs, and has their own backstory and arcs. Many characters you may start off hating but then end up liking later on as they go through redemption arcs.

My favourite would have to be A Storm of Swords, where the end and the aftermath of the War of the Five Kings causes political discord in King's Landing, and A Feast for Crows, which deals with the horiffic aftermath of war, as a character tours the war-torn Riverlands and Crownlands and encounters broken men and beleaguered peasants. 

- The Stand, Stephen King

This is my favourite Stephen King novel by far. It deals with the aftermath of the breakdown of the world, caused by a superflu. The characters are fantastic, and the narrative is hard-hitting and sometimes brutal in Stephen King's style. It deals with themes of religion and God, good versus evil, survival, community, and friendship. The main chunk of the story follows one group of good characters who are converging on Hemingford Home, Nebraska, to meet a woman called Mother Abagail who has visited them all in dreams. Another group, comprised of bad characters and technical specialists, converge on Las Vegas to work for Randall Flagg, a supernatural drifter and the embodiment of evil, and both groups try to rebuild society.

Do yourself a favour and read the Complete and Uncut Edition, which adds 400 pages back to the novel which needed to be cut for the original manuscript to be published. This was because publishers did not think readers would want such a long book when it was first published. It adds back chapters that extend several characters' stories, which really improve the novel. This book was perfect for me. It had a post-apocalyptic setting (and covered the whole buildup before the collapse), compelling characters with interesting backstories, and it left a lasting impression on me that left me wanting for more.

- IT, Stephen King

My second-favourite Stephen King novel (tied with _The Green Mile_), IT tells the story of the cursed town of Derry, Maine, which is haunted by a supernatural eldritch being of pure evil, that terrorizes the town by playing on ITs victim's fears and phobias. IT most often appears as Pennywise the Clown, which appears in the town's history once every twenty-seven years, and is responsible for horrific acts of violence. The book follows two timelines of the group of social outcasts who call themselves The Loser's Club, who fight back against IT when they are children, and again as adults. While King can sometimes ramble on a bit, the power of the novel comes with the accuracy and nostalgia with which he writes his child characters. We all remember being kids, being afraid of irrational things, but this novel takes that irrational thing and turns it into a very real danger. It deals with themes of abuse, the power of memory, fear, childhood trauma, and friendship.

My favourite parts of this book were the flashbacks to earlier times in Derry's history, where people notice Pennywise the Clown before a cataclysmic or violent event occurs. The standout of these involves Dick Hallorann, a character that also appears in The Shining. The chapters where IT's murders and terrifying forms are described are also extremely visceral and suspenseful.

- Blood Meridian, Cormac McCarthy

"Whatever exists without my knowledge, exists without my consent.". This bleak and beautiful, terrifyingly violent novel is about a Tennessean drifter known only as The Kid, who joins the army and later the Glanton gang in order to scalp and massacre Native Americans and other tribes along the US-Mexico borderlands in the Old West. He and the gang do this first for profit, but are later consumed by bloodlust and a compulsion for violence. Cormac McCarthy paints haunting landscapes with poetic language, and the imagery in this novel made my head spin. It was a difficult read, but well worth it, and is full of insight on war, God, death, the true nature of man, and the uncaring natural world itself. Definitely my favourite Cormac McCarthy book.
