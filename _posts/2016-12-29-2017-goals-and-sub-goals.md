It's that time of year again. For the past two years, I've written up a list of goals and sub-goals that I want to achieve for the year. The first thing I usually do is recap what goals I made in the previous year, and go over what I achieved, before outlining the next year's goals! So without further ado, here is the review.

### 2016 Review

**Goal 1 - Get married.**

Didn't do this one...yet! Time just got away with us, and we ended up spending our money on other things (a new PC and a trip to Japan!). We will get there one day but we are in no big rush, our little family is chugging along just fine! If we do get married in the next year, it will be a little civil ceremony with a celebration with family afterwards, nothing too crazy.

**Goal 2 - Pay off credit card debt.**

This was done....kinda! We consolidated it with my personal loan into one personal loan, which is so much better. If anyone is worried about their credit card debt, I recommend doing something similar. The main benefit is that you have one payment to make, and you cannot get further in debt. Ideally, you wouldn't go into debt in the first place, but that is sometimes hard to avoid. Many people have to learn this lesson the hard way.

If the temptation to use "free money" is there, then you sure as hell are going to use it. If we ever get a credit card again, it will be the lowest limit possible, and used in very specific or emergency situations. A tip I've heard of is to freeze your credit card in ice so you can't just use it whenever you want. You are forced to consider your decisions.

**Goal 3 - Complete a 50km bike ride.**

Didn't quite get here. To be honest I have been slack with my long distance rides. The furthest I got was 20km. I still ride everyday from home to the train station, but I need to get on top of the rides again this year. This is more to do with lack of commitment than anything, so it's my bad!

**Goal 4 - Complete a first draft of the novel Iâ€™m writing.**

Ding ding ding! We have a winner here. I completed the first draft of my novel with a week to spare, on the **23rd of December 2016**. The draft is approximately 85,000 words, and the story is about the fall of a once-great motorcycle club, the Crabs MC, which is a rabble of losers and misfits that can't even intimidate the residents of the peaceful town they live in. They are bossed around by the Devil's Faithful MC, and one last heist will make or break their club. The Rider, a loyal member, rides a bicycle with a two-stroke engine, ever since his own bike was stolen, and he and the gang will need a hell of a lot of help to pull the job off.

It was a wonderful experience to write a novel, and it was a lot of work. I wrote the whole thing longhand then typed it up once I wrote ten pages or so ahead. The process was interesting. The starting point of the story was really from a single character, The Rider, which I thought of when I saw a man riding a bicycle with a two-stroke engine attached one day in West End. I wrote an initial outline with some main story points, and thought up some other club members. Right from the outset I wanted the club to suck, to be the underdog losers, and be lorded over by another motorcycle club.

I wrote about five thousand words in the last months of 2013, then pretty much forgot about my story in 2014 (it was a tumultuous year with the birth of my first son, Patrick). Then, in 2015, I wrote around 20k words throughout the year and outlined more as I got a better idea of where the story was going. A lot of this time was spent getting my process down, which ended up being writing longhand first and then typing into the computer later, to avoid distractions. I found out that I'm a combination between an architect and a gardener, writing an overarching outline for the novel, then detailed 5-10 chapter outlines at a time, and diverging from the outline organically when I find a direction worth going in. Finally this last year in 2016 I wrote the rest, with a lot more breaks and slacking off than was necessary (Reddit is a hell of a drug).

With my next novel I aim to write the whole first draft a lot quicker, within a year ideally. I've got a couple of ideas rattling around in my head, one a fantasy novel about a tale of two kingdoms, one undead and one human. The other idea is a post-zombie apocalypse story, a few years after where everyone is trying to get society back together and deal with the remaining zombies. I'm excited to dive into this next project, but the year ahead will involve a lot of meticulous editing for my novel, and I plan on writing 2-3 short stories instead of a new novel this year, and hopefully knock one over in 2018 after writing a chunky outline.

**Goal 5 - Spend more quality time with my sons.**

This is going great as well. I get to spend quite a lot of time with my boys, and it is wonderful to see them grow and change. As any parent knows there are rocky patches and ups and downs, but despite those I love the boys more than anything. We will all be going to Japan next May as one big family, visiting Osaka, Nara, and Kyoto, which will be ana amazing experience. I've also started working one day a week on Wednesday, so I get to drop them off and pick them up from daycare on that day.

### 2017 Goals

Okay with the retrospective out of the way, here are my 2017 goals.

**Goal 1 - Whenever I finish a book, write a summary of essay of the book to this website**

- I often read books then don't really remember much of them, or the point of them, unless they had a big impact on me. I got this idea from a friend, so after I read every book on my reading list this year I will write a short summary or essay here.
- I hope this will help me improve as a writer to analyse books I read, and to make me remember the details a little better.
- I will be posting a reading list for this year, as well as a list of books I read last year, on this site too in the next week or so.

**Goal 2 - Write one article per month on my technical blog**

- The goal here is related to consistency. I've run [a tech/programming blog](https://martin-brennan.com) for the past four and a half years, since July 2012. I often write between twelve and fifteen articles a year there, but I want to ensure I write one per month guaranteed to keep up momentum there.
- This is so I can build my readership up some more, and to review any technical discoveries I make at work.
- A stretch goal related to this would be to write twenty-four articles on the website for the coming year, two per month.
- This should be fairly simple to do, I already have ten article ideas and more will come during the year from work.

**Goal 3 - Write three short stories, and finalise editing on my Crabs MC novel**

- There is a trend here, I want to write a lot this year. I've spent entirely too much time on Reddit and other time wasting websites, so I want to do more CREATING instead of CONSUMING this year, because it's very mindless and instantly gratifying to consume but not at all fulfilling.
- I want to complete one short story I'm already writing, and complete two others. Each short story should be ten to fifteen thousand words.
- I also want to go through rounds of drafts and editing for Crabs MC until I am happy with it. I am new to this process, but I already have ideas in mind on what needs to change, and I plan to print out the whole manuscript and hand edit it by hand as well. I know there will be a lot of work involved because I focused on getting the words down rather than writing the best prose.
- It would be wonderful if I could start writing query letters to publishers in early 2018.

**Goal 4 - Go on at least one camping trip with friends and one solo camping trip**

- One of my major life goals is to complete a thru-hike of the [Appalachian Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Trail), a feat that requires a lot of physical and mental strength. I want to do this when I am around thirty-five or so, because it will necessitate taking six months away from work.
- I want to do this because I enjoy hiking a lot, and I've been doing it since I was around eighteen, with little trips when I was younger.
- I don't have much camping experience or equipment, because I wasn't at all a fan of camping when I was younger, so I need to build both of these up gradually, and become an experienced outdoorsman before attempting the hike.
- I also hope between now and that time that I will get to hike in other countries, or different parts of Australia at least.

**Goal 5 - Get a boat license**

- I wanted to do this in 2016 but our surprise purchasing of a Japan trip got in the way of this!
- We live in Wynnum, which is very close to Manly harbor. I would love to be able to take the boys out on boat trips, and I really enjoy the ocean as well. My partner grew up near the ocean too so she will love it.
- The license lasts a lifetime, so in later years it would be good to perhaps own a boat, and go out on the sea in solitude and write.

**Goal 6 - Get rid of Reddit**

- I've already started this. I cannot begin to count how many hours I've spent mindlessly scrolling through Reddit when I could have been doing something productive or useful. I've already gotten rid of it off my phone, and unsubscribed from all of the subreddits that I was subscribed to. Some of these were quite toxic too, and I am finding it's doing wonders for my mood and mental state not having it. I haven't looked at it since boxing day, and I do not plan to.

So that's it, my goals for this year. I will measure how much I write over the year and have some sort of summary in next year's review. I hope everyone has a safe, happy, and productive 2017!
