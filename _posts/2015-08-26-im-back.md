Unbeknownst to me my site was down for 7 days with the message &#8220;Error establishing a database connection.&#8221;. This occurs when the `mysql` service crashes on the server. I currently have no way to get notified of this, so any tips on how to do so on a DigitalOcean droplet would be great! The command used to get the `mysql` service up and running again is:

    sudo service mysql restart
