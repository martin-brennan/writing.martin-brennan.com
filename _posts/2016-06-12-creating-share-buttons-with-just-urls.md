I came across this Gist on how to create share buttons with just URLs while converting my blog to Jekyll, which is what I use at the start of each post:

It shows how to create Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, Linkedin, Pinterest, Tumblr links. Scroll through the comments on the Gist to see the updated sharing links.
