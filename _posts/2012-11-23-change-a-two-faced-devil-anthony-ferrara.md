Change is always unavoidable in software projects; without it, our applications would not grow and evolve but would rather remain stagnant and unusable, and eventually collapse under their own weight. This article by Anthony Ferrara goes over the difference between Constructive Change and Destructive Change, which hit close to home with me at the moment because at work we are going through some destructive changes to our LMS application, that will ultimately be for everyone&#8217;s benefit. Users and developers included.
