Last year, I wrote a post called 2015 Goals and Sub-Goals, in which I outlined five goals I had for the year and ways in which I could achieve them. Happily, I did achieve most of them, and I’ve got another set for 2016 as well. First I’ll go over the ones from last year.

### 2015 Review

**Goal 1 - Earn more money, and further my career.**

I’m happy to say I’ve done this, I moved to a job with a 40% pay raise over my previous one which has allowed me to focus in one area of development, front-end development. I’ve been working extensively with Angular and ES6 JavaScript, which I’ve been loving. My new job is fantastic and I work with a great bunch of people, I can see myself staying here for the foreseeable future.

**Goal 2 - Plan time for a healthier lifestyle with my fianće.**

Again, hit the mark right here. We’ve both become vegetarians in the past year and our health has improved significantly. In addition, I’ve taken up cycling which I’ve loved more than I ever thought I would, I’ve never really ridden a bike or been comfortable doing it before now. As well as this I’ve been heading to the gym much more consistently, riding there on my bike when I can as well as riding to the train station each day, which is a 10km round trip.

**Goal 3 - Move to a house.**

Sort of. We are moving into a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom townhouse which is still a massive size and space improvement for us and our growing family. It is closer to the bayside, and it has a yard, so it offers a better lifestyle and a possibility of a puppy!

**Goal 4 - Work on my quickness to annoyance, work on not reacting without thinking, and think about the impact this behaviour has on my family.**

This one was about not getting annoyed about or overreacting over trivial things, and spending more time with my family and developing a better relationship with all of them. This is still ongoing. My fiance and I have decided to try new things and spend more quality time together this year. She will be getting a bike soon as well so that will be another thing we can do together. We’ve added another son to the mix, so I’ve been spending time with him as well as our firstborn. I love my family more than anything else, so this one is important to me. Being mindful of your own emotions and thoughts and actions is essential.

**Goal 5 - Continue to develop my craft.**

This is about both programming and writing. I’ve learned a lot over the past year about JavaScript, Angular and front-end development. Though with more commitments I haven’t really had much time to focus on open source projects or working on code in my spare time, so that’s no longer big of a part in my life. I prefer to keep furthering my knowledge through work, which I’ve found is a much better place for learning (as long as you are in a challenging work environment), as it forces you to sink or swim, so to speak. I’d love to delve into lower level languages like C, C++ and the like but I’ve no real reason to. Even getting to write some good ol’ C# would be great, though I may get the opportunity to do that again through work. I’ve largely stopped writing Ruby and I don’t think there’s any point learning native mobile development anymore, at least for me. I’ve written quite a few articles for my tech blog this year, though in the last six months with a lot going on my ideas have dried up for that for now.

Writing is a different story. This year, I’ve written 20,000 words of a novel, that I’m going to continue to write this year. Journaling hasn’t been as well maintained, I found it good at first but a chore to keep up with after a few months. I’m loving fiction writing, so that’s where I’ll keep my focus. I plan to finish a first draft of the book this year, and I will try to write a few short stories along the way, maybe even make a few submissions to lit mags or journals. I’ve been writing fiction longhand first, which I’ve found to work much better for me because I can write little edits or corrections on the fly and easily draw out diagrams, outlines and crappy pictures if need be.

### 2016 Goals
Here we go, my goals for this year in their entirety.

**Goal 1 - Get married.**

- The love of my life and I have been engaged for almost a year and a half now, and we have two wonderful boys. It’s time to make it official!
- We are aiming for a wedding in September. That way, our second born will be 1 and our first born will be 2 and a half. It won’t be anything extravagant, we don’t have thousands of dollars to spend on a fancy wedding. We just want to become man and wife as we’ve wanted to for so long.
- It will likely just be a small civil ceremony, and we will have to register our intent to marry by August.

**Goal 2 - Pay off credit card debt.**

- Part of the reason we can’t have a more extravagant wedding and lifestyle is because we have both personal loan and credit card debt.
- The credit card has come the closest it ever has to being paid off, and I’m aiming to pay the several thousand dollar balance of this year, along with avoiding using it at all.
- This will free up a chunk of extra money every fortnight for savings, living expenses and activities for the boys. And yes, maybe even a night out with my partner every once and a while!

**Goal 3 - Complete a 50km bike ride.**

- Since getting into riding I’ve fallen in love with it. It’s great fun just to hop on your bike and go wherever you want, purely by your own power and ability.
- I recently did a 16km ride, the longest one I’ve done so far, and it was much easier than I thought it would be. Moving closer to the bayside this year, I have a lot more interesting places to ride to.
- To achieve this, I will go on progressively longer rides, aiming for a 25km at first and working up. I’m going to upgrade my gear as well by getting gloves, jersey and bike shorts as well as upgrading to clipless pedals and bike shoes for more power.
- Stretch goal is a 100km ride! All will be recorded on Strava.

**Goal 4 - Complete a first draft of the novel I’m writing.**

- This means cranking out at least something like 45,000 words between now and December, I’ve already written 20,000 and I have a good idea of where I want to story to go and an outline.
- It doesn’t matter if it’s pure, unfiltered shit, as long as I’ve got the first draft done and words on the page.
- In addition to this goal, I want to write at least two short stories, between 5 to 10 thousand words. This is all going toward a goal of improving my writing.
- If I’m feeling suicidal, and if I have a good idea, I’ll even attempt NaNoWriMo.

**Goal 5 - Spend more quality time with my sons.**

- Quality time is time I’m playing with them or helping them learn. This is especially important with my older son, who will be two in March.
- This may involve signing them up for activities like swimming or a toddler sport activity.
- Helping my son learn will involve reading with him, painting and drawing, and doing other learning activities to do with expanding his vocabulary.
- I’ll be able to do this a lot more this year because I’ve changed my work hours so I’m home earlier at night. I love my boys and I want to have more fun with them, because I won’t get this time back!

There it is, my list of goals for the coming year. I hope that this year is fruitful for myself, my family, and everyone else!
