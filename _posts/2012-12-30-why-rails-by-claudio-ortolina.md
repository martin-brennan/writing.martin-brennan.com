I&#8217;ve been coding another app recently to learn [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) and by extension [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org). I thought I&#8217;d link to [Claudio&#8217;s](http://claudio-ortolina.org/) article that recently appeared on [Nettuts+](http://net.tutsplus.com) that outlines some reasons why you might want to start learning Rails and Ruby. [Why Rails by Claudio Ortolina](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby/why-rails/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nettuts+%28Nettuts%2B%29). 

For me, the main reasons that I wanted to start learning Rails was because there is always plenty of buzz about it in the web development community, and I&#8217;d started learning the syntax of Ruby and I really liked how simple and expressive it was.

The [MVC architecture](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) of Rails also appealed to me, and I was looking for a change from .Net. I&#8217;ve found that its great for MVC and RESTful URLs, and I&#8217;ve been really enjoying how easy it is to separate concerns, and the ease of use of creating business and database logic using Models has been a godsend.

I&#8217;ve had a couple of hiccups so far with my learning but I can already see that I am going to enjoy learning and using Rails.
