This was an extremely frustrating problem I came across when building an API using .NET MVC 4. I was using HTTP POST to send a model to the API using JSON, and relying on the built in Model-binding to correctly interpret the JSON and convert it to a model. However, for one particular model none of the properties were binding correctly. After a lot of head scratching and threatening my computer screen, I found this post by Anders Ã…berg<!--more-->:

[.NET MVC 4 Model Binding null on POST](http://ideasof.andersaberg.com/idea/9/net-mvc-4-model-binding-null-on-post)

Basically, take this model for an example of how the problem occurs. This represents a message in some sort of chat system:

```csharp
public class ChatMessage
{
    public int ID { get; set; }
    public string Message { get; set; }
    public bool Read { get; set; }
}
```

And your API for example has a Controller method that accepts a HTTP POST request to add a new message:

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public ActionResult Send( ChatMessage message)
{
    var id = Chat.Send(message);
    return Content(id);
}
```

And then the JSON POST body would look something like this:

```json
{
  "ID": null,
  "Message": "Hey how's it going?",
  "Read": false
}
```

{% include in-post-ad.html %}

You would expect that the model would be bound correctly and that all the properties would be filled in correctly right? Right?! WRONG! Because I&#8217;ve named the parameter for the `Send` method the same thing as one of the model&#8217;s properties, `Message`. This really confuses the model binder because it&#8217;s trying to just use the message **property** and binding it to the **model**, instead of just counting as a property of the model.

There are two things you can do to get around this:

  1. Don&#8217;t name any of your method parameters the same thing as any of your model&#8217;s properties! E.g. newMessage instead of message.
  2. Don&#8217;t name your model properties anything similar to the name of the model class, as you may want to use it as a variable name. E.g. MessageText instead of Message.
