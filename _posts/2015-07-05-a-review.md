Over the next week or so I&#8217;m going to be blowing out the cobwebs of this blog so to speak, in a review, because I&#8217;ve been neglecting it quite a bit and I want it to be a better platform for my tech writing. I&#8217;m aiming to:

  * Rewrite the theme (again) for an easier to read and navigate blog, including the return of syntax highlighting. I&#8217;d previously converted about half of my code samples to use gists but I am going to go back to using a syntax highlighter (probably prism or highlight.js) to reduce load.
  * Go through old posts and put disclaimers on those that are old and probably no longer valid, or have misleading information. I may just implement a flag for posts to display this warning so Â I don&#8217;t have to do it manually.
  * Speed up the performance of my site. If anyone has any tips on speeding up WordPress I&#8217;m all ears, I&#8217;ve tried to do a lot of things but they don&#8217;t seem to work for long. I may end up upgrading to a larger digitalocean droplet.

Apart from that, I aim to come up with more articles more frequently, a lot about JavaScript since that is what I&#8217;m primarily working with now. Thanks for reading, the changes will be coming soon.
