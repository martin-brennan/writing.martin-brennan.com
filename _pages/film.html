<p>Over the fast few years I've taken up film photography. The experience of slowing down and seeing the results much later is a much more satisfying way of taking photos for me. The film shots I've taken I consider to be 100x better than anything I've ever taken on digital cameras, and they feel a lot more alive to me. Here is a selection of the shots I've taken that I consider the better ones. Many of them were shot on my dad's old Chinon CM-4s, but since August 2022 I have been shooting on a Canon AE-1 Program.</p>

<div class="film-thumbnail-container">
  {% for negative in site.film reversed %}
    <a class="film-thumbnail-item internal-link" href="{{ negative.url }}" title="{{ negative.title }}">
      <img src="/assets/film/thumbnails/{{ negative.url | replace: "/film/", "" | replace: "/", "" }}.jpg" alt="{{ negative.title }}" />
    </a>
  {% endfor %}
</div>

The article is at <a href="https://devonzuegel.com/post/travel-photos-are-underrated">Travel photos are underrated</a>, and jeena's own photo grid <a href="https://jeena.net/photos">is over at their website</a>.
